1
00:00:02,503 --> 00:00:05,755
[Grey] <i>On average, a healthy person
can hold their breath for up to a minute.</i>

2
00:00:05,756 --> 00:00:08,676
I could have all of you replaced
by tomorrow.

3
00:00:09,343 --> 00:00:12,554
What about me? Can you replace me?

4
00:00:12,555 --> 00:00:16,182
<i>After that, carbon dioxide in your blood
starts to dramatically rise.</i>

5
00:00:16,183 --> 00:00:18,935
Do you know how many doctors
I have replaced in my career?

6
00:00:18,936 --> 00:00:20,437
Your rejects can stay,

7
00:00:20,438 --> 00:00:24,607
but your salary will pay for the lawyers
who will fix their mistakes.

8
00:00:24,608 --> 00:00:26,736
You're done here, Dr. Bailey. Goodbye.

9
00:00:30,364 --> 00:00:32,323
- No.
- Get out of my office.

10
00:00:32,324 --> 00:00:35,035
I refuse to allow my job
to be taken by someone

11
00:00:35,036 --> 00:00:37,996
who only operates on spite and greed.

12
00:00:37,997 --> 00:00:40,290
You don't see faces. You see dollars.

13
00:00:40,291 --> 00:00:44,294
That's because this hospital
and your leadership is costing me money.

14
00:00:44,295 --> 00:00:47,380
This profession is a calling,
not a business.

15
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:50,800
When was the last time
you actually stepped into an OR?

16
00:00:50,801 --> 00:00:52,886
Saved a human life with your hands?

17
00:00:52,887 --> 00:00:56,723
I was doing penis transplants
while you were knee-deep in the sandbox.

18
00:00:56,724 --> 00:01:00,185
Ah. You strut around
and straighten Richard's tie

19
00:01:00,186 --> 00:01:01,728
while the rest of us do the work.

20
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:04,606
No, I do the work. They do the work.

21
00:01:04,607 --> 00:01:07,776
You don't get to fire me.
You don't deserve to fire me.

22
00:01:07,777 --> 00:01:10,612
You think you're God's gift
to this hospital? Please.

23
00:01:10,613 --> 00:01:15,701
It won't even notice the second you walk
out that door. You're just another doctor.

24
00:01:21,707 --> 00:01:24,501
- <i>Eventually, a reflex is triggered.</i>
- [Bailey gasps]

25
00:01:24,502 --> 00:01:26,878
<i>And if you resist the urge
to let it all out...</i>

26
00:01:26,879 --> 00:01:28,254
You had the dream again?

27
00:01:28,255 --> 00:01:29,255
<i>...you pass out...</i>

28
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:32,300
- What happened this time?
- I slapped her.

29
00:01:32,301 --> 00:01:35,012
<i>...and you don't know all the damage
you could have caused.</i>

30
00:01:40,601 --> 00:01:43,436
[protestors] <i>Save our planet!
Pollution'snosolution!</i>

31
00:01:43,437 --> 00:01:47,023
<i>Save our planet! Pollution's no solution!</i>

32
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:59,912
Save our planet! Pollution's no solution!
Save our planet! Pollution's no solution!

33
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,705
Yeah, we're gonna be here a while.

34
00:02:02,706 --> 00:02:04,875
They shut down the whole bridge
for the protesters.

35
00:02:05,918 --> 00:02:07,919
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

36
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:09,587
You sure? You look weird.

37
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:10,756
Thanks?

38
00:02:11,549 --> 00:02:12,967
So...

39
00:02:14,802 --> 00:02:17,221
I spy or murder podcast?

40
00:02:19,223 --> 00:02:25,020
Actually, there is something
that I should talk to you about. So, um...

41
00:02:27,898 --> 00:02:29,607
Is that trash?

42
00:02:29,608 --> 00:02:32,361
Yeah! Stop polluting, start living!

43
00:02:34,613 --> 00:02:35,905
What? They're saving the planet.

44
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:39,659
By throwing trash
and risking their lives bungee jumping?

45
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:42,704
These events always attract
a few rogue players,

46
00:02:42,705 --> 00:02:45,040
but it's the overall message
that's important.

47
00:02:46,041 --> 00:02:47,625
Just do your thing already.

48
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:50,837
Do you know what global warming has done
to the insect disease vectors?

49
00:02:50,838 --> 00:02:54,550
The tick population has exploded.
Do you want Lyme disease, Jo?

50
00:02:55,259 --> 00:02:59,263
The ten hottest years have happened
in the last decade.

51
00:03:01,056 --> 00:03:02,808
Well, we're late in eight minutes.

52
00:03:05,144 --> 00:03:07,688
- Who are you stalking now?
- No one.

53
00:03:09,273 --> 00:03:12,275
Adams has to give his decision today.
About Chicago.

54
00:03:12,276 --> 00:03:15,320
Oh, Dr. Fox didn't change her mind
about him. Why wouldn't he go?

55
00:03:15,321 --> 00:03:17,323
Because Griffith.

56
00:03:18,407 --> 00:03:20,825
You know, at this point,
we should just fire ourselves.

57
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:23,161
- Uh, Griffith tried that already.
- Uh, Griffith's right here.

58
00:03:23,162 --> 00:03:26,915
Just... If you told him how you feel,
he would change his mind.

59
00:03:26,916 --> 00:03:29,542
She staged a coup on his behalf.
How does that not say how she...

60
00:03:29,543 --> 00:03:30,585
Still here.

61
00:03:30,586 --> 00:03:32,379
Because it's Adams.

62
00:03:36,717 --> 00:03:38,551
Okay. You know what? Yeah.

63
00:03:38,552 --> 00:03:42,389
Hi. Hi. Yeah, we compost.
Can you let us through?

64
00:03:43,224 --> 00:03:44,683
We love trees.

65
00:03:47,478 --> 00:03:49,229
Where is Simms Memorial?

66
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:50,564
Spokane, I think.

67
00:03:51,398 --> 00:03:52,398
Why?

68
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,317
Mmm. Recruiter says
they're interested in me.

69
00:03:54,318 --> 00:03:55,902
It's in Eugene, Oregon.

70
00:03:55,903 --> 00:03:59,697
That is far,
but a job's a job. I will commute.

71
00:03:59,698 --> 00:04:01,783
I just wish you didn't have to look.

72
00:04:01,784 --> 00:04:03,077
Dr. Meredith Grey?

73
00:04:04,078 --> 00:04:06,247
- Check the third floor.
- Your picture's in the hall.

74
00:04:06,872 --> 00:04:07,915
Not for long.

75
00:04:09,583 --> 00:04:11,167
It's an injunction
from the Fox Foundation.

76
00:04:11,168 --> 00:04:13,963
If you don't respond, you could be held
in contempt of the court.

77
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:18,675
- Okay. Do you want to go to jail?
- [phone chimes]

78
00:04:18,676 --> 00:04:21,219
- Because I really, really don't.
- [Grey gasps]

79
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:22,345
Oh.

80
00:04:22,346 --> 00:04:24,473
- What?
- NYU pulled their funding.

81
00:04:25,307 --> 00:04:27,809
Fox Foundation sent a cease and desist.

82
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:31,479
Well, that's the second institution
that has dropped us in a week.

83
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:32,730
Mm-hmm.

84
00:04:32,731 --> 00:04:35,109
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna keep packing.

85
00:04:36,777 --> 00:04:39,154
I still don't have any notes for Thursday.

86
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:43,284
I swear to God, if somebody doesn't
find my damn cell phone...

87
00:04:45,119 --> 00:04:47,620
- Hi, baby.
- Hey, Mama.

88
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,832
[Avery] Oh! Coffee, Ingrid.

89
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,959
All right. How was London?

90
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:54,419
When you texted me about Meredith,

91
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:56,879
you failed to mention you fired Hunt
and Altman, Mom.

92
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,548
Don't forget about Shepherd and Bailey.

93
00:04:58,549 --> 00:04:59,466
Really?

94
00:04:59,467 --> 00:05:01,634
Oh, come on. I kept the interns.

95
00:05:01,635 --> 00:05:03,177
Richard reminded me that if I didn't,

96
00:05:03,178 --> 00:05:05,263
we'd lose our government funding
for the programs.

97
00:05:05,264 --> 00:05:07,765
And Lord knows we can't stand
to lose another dime.

98
00:05:07,766 --> 00:05:09,642
These are top surgeons
we're talking about.

99
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:13,689
If they can't respect the Foundation, then
they shouldn't work for it. End of story.

100
00:05:14,982 --> 00:05:17,317
What about Meredith? You at least try
to talk to her since she quit?

101
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:21,070
I wouldn't talk
to that entitled fire starter

102
00:05:21,071 --> 00:05:23,781
if we were the last two remaining people
on this earth

103
00:05:23,782 --> 00:05:25,825
and it was the only way
to save civilization.

104
00:05:25,826 --> 00:05:28,202
Okay. Did you read their abstract
at least?

105
00:05:28,203 --> 00:05:29,537
Of course I did.

106
00:05:29,538 --> 00:05:32,040
Okay. Data seems pretty incredible.

107
00:05:32,041 --> 00:05:36,754
Yeah. That's why we're not gonna stop
until we get it all back.

108
00:05:38,047 --> 00:05:39,381
Mm-hmm.

109
00:05:43,552 --> 00:05:48,515
- Mrs. Nevins needs an updated... Thank you.
- Prescription. I got you.

110
00:05:49,516 --> 00:05:52,518
I know volunteering at the clinic
isn't exactly what you had in mind

111
00:05:52,519 --> 00:05:54,187
when you left SFD.

112
00:05:54,188 --> 00:05:56,189
I am helping people and you.

113
00:05:56,190 --> 00:05:58,317
But it might not be for much longer.

114
00:05:58,942 --> 00:06:01,904
Residency director at Seattle Pres can
squeeze me in for an interview next week.

115
00:06:02,946 --> 00:06:04,697
Um, what about Grey-Sloan?

116
00:06:04,698 --> 00:06:06,532
I'm not applying to any Fox hospitals.

117
00:06:06,533 --> 00:06:08,951
Your loyalty isn't necessary.

118
00:06:08,952 --> 00:06:10,788
Catherine let you go. You.

119
00:06:11,997 --> 00:06:15,459
I don't trust her. And you wanted
to slap her. You know, and then...

120
00:06:17,294 --> 00:06:18,295
What?

121
00:06:21,423 --> 00:06:24,175
I heard a rumor that
the new residency director starts today.

122
00:06:24,176 --> 00:06:27,805
Oh. Well, good.

123
00:06:30,391 --> 00:06:33,726
- You're okay?
- [scoffs] I'm in my clinic.

124
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,896
I've got more time for the kids,
opportunities to pursue research.

125
00:06:36,897 --> 00:06:42,903
Never been better. I wish the
new person best of luck. They'll need it.

126
00:06:45,155 --> 00:06:45,989
Mm-hmm.

127
00:06:52,162 --> 00:06:54,331
- Whoa. Sorry.
- It's all good.

128
00:06:55,416 --> 00:07:00,711
- Nervous? About the new boss.
- Right. No.

129
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:02,755
[Griffith] Yasuda said today's
the deadline.

130
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:04,841
Yeah. End of day.

131
00:07:04,842 --> 00:07:06,260
I haven't decided.

132
00:07:07,010 --> 00:07:09,221
Both places have their pros and cons.

133
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:13,683
[doctor] The energy's so warm in here
it reminds me of a mother's womb.

134
00:07:13,684 --> 00:07:16,228
[laughs] Not that I remember
being in one, but...

135
00:07:17,521 --> 00:07:22,024
Hi. I am Sydney Heron.
I am your new fearless leader. [chuckles]

136
00:07:22,025 --> 00:07:25,069
I mean, not new-new. You know,
I did my residency here.

137
00:07:25,070 --> 00:07:27,573
So think of me as one of you guys, okay?

138
00:07:28,449 --> 00:07:30,868
Who's ready to heal with love?

139
00:07:31,702 --> 00:07:34,495
- Shouldn't we be getting our assignments?
- While moving quickly?

140
00:07:34,496 --> 00:07:38,040
Uh, no. The better I know you,
the better surgeon I can make you.

141
00:07:38,041 --> 00:07:41,795
So, name, nickname,
novel you've always wanted to write.

142
00:07:42,588 --> 00:07:45,757
Who wants to go first, huh? [laughs]

143
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:55,391
Hey, you two. Congratulations
on making it to work through the traffic.

144
00:07:55,392 --> 00:07:57,685
- You drive electric, Schmitt?
- I ride a bike.

145
00:07:57,686 --> 00:08:00,855
Even better. Hey, you're with me today.
Meet me downstairs in 20.

146
00:08:00,856 --> 00:08:01,773
Okay.

147
00:08:01,774 --> 00:08:03,274
I keep trying to tell him.

148
00:08:03,275 --> 00:08:08,363
And then everyone got fired, and it felt
weird to celebrate something.

149
00:08:12,409 --> 00:08:13,659
I'm scared of how he's gonna react.

150
00:08:13,660 --> 00:08:16,245
And I'm scared of how I'll react
to how he reacts. And...

151
00:08:16,246 --> 00:08:17,455
[sighs] Okay.

152
00:08:17,456 --> 00:08:20,041
What? I don't make fun of your fears.

153
00:08:20,042 --> 00:08:22,043
That's literally what
our entire friendship is based on.

154
00:08:22,044 --> 00:08:23,127
Well, whatever.

155
00:08:23,128 --> 00:08:25,379
He thinks the world
is gonna end tomorrow anyway

156
00:08:25,380 --> 00:08:27,798
from melting ice caps,
so maybe none of this matters.

157
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,009
Maybe it doesn't matter
if you don't have a baby

158
00:08:30,010 --> 00:08:32,553
because I won't be a peds surgeon
that can take care of it.

159
00:08:32,554 --> 00:08:35,556
- Why does my baby need surgery?
- That was a hypothetical.

160
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:39,936
No, your peds fellowship
is a hypothetical. I'm actually pregnant.

161
00:08:39,937 --> 00:08:43,106
And you don't think that
that is minimizing my fears?

162
00:08:43,899 --> 00:08:45,067
I have to throw up.

163
00:08:45,984 --> 00:08:49,112
You can't just use that as an excuse
to not answer the...

164
00:08:52,824 --> 00:08:53,825
Ndugu,

165
00:08:54,535 --> 00:08:58,538
I saw that you put my name on the board
for the Ivor Lewis this afternoon.

166
00:08:58,539 --> 00:08:59,998
You need to find someone else.

167
00:09:00,707 --> 00:09:02,333
I need help upstairs.

168
00:09:02,334 --> 00:09:06,087
Thanks to your wife, my department's down
Altman, and I'm running Owen's service.

169
00:09:06,088 --> 00:09:08,298
And I'm the interim chief.

170
00:09:10,425 --> 00:09:13,220
Are you avoiding the OR
after what happened with Garrett?

171
00:09:14,513 --> 00:09:17,848
Once his aneurysm ruptured, he had a
high mortality rate no matter what we did.

172
00:09:17,849 --> 00:09:22,646
Yes, it was a bad outcome, but that's just
what it was, not a sign of anything else.

173
00:09:23,313 --> 00:09:26,816
I didn't ask your opinion. I'm not
scrubbing in on complex procedures...

174
00:09:26,817 --> 00:09:28,235
[tires screech]

175
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:32,531
[driver] No, no, no, don't. Oh...

176
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:36,617
Is he dead? Is he dead?

177
00:09:36,618 --> 00:09:38,453
Is this simple enough for you?

178
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:50,089
{\an8}Jackson. Hey. I read your article
on salvaging compromised flaps.

179
00:09:50,090 --> 00:09:51,299
{\an8}Uh-huh.

180
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:54,594
{\an8}- I don't know how you have time to... Uh.
- Where is she?

181
00:09:54,595 --> 00:09:55,720
{\an8}Welcome back.

182
00:09:55,721 --> 00:09:58,764
{\an8}You know, you're supposed to respond
to these, Mer. You have a lawyer?

183
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,393
{\an8}- Can you recommend one?
- Meredith...

184
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,522
{\an8}Can you tell Catherine to stop
sending cease and desist letters

185
00:10:06,523 --> 00:10:09,191
{\an8}to everyone who's interested
in a potential Alzheimer's cure?

186
00:10:09,192 --> 00:10:11,652
{\an8}Your abstract broke the field.
What do you expect?

187
00:10:11,653 --> 00:10:14,739
{\an8}Right, and now a lot of people
wanna work with us.

188
00:10:14,740 --> 00:10:17,325
{\an8}Those people aware
of your misuse of funds,

189
00:10:17,326 --> 00:10:19,577
{\an8}breach of contract, a signed noncompete?

190
00:10:19,578 --> 00:10:21,370
{\an8}I'm not here
to make things easier for you.

191
00:10:21,371 --> 00:10:23,664
{\an8}I was also the source of those letters.

192
00:10:23,665 --> 00:10:26,627
{\an8}Something you would know if you
answered any of my calls or texts.

193
00:10:33,091 --> 00:10:35,052
Look, I need a crash cart and a C-collar.

194
00:10:36,053 --> 00:10:38,304
Adams, fire department's on the way.
Can you feel a pulse?

195
00:10:38,305 --> 00:10:41,641
Yeah, I'm trying, but he looks pretty...
Yeah, th-there's a pulse.

196
00:10:41,642 --> 00:10:43,643
All right.
Diminished breath sounds bilaterally,

197
00:10:43,644 --> 00:10:46,270
{\an8}abrasions, no apparent deep lacerations.

198
00:10:46,271 --> 00:10:48,898
{\an8}- I'm Dr. Adams. Can you tell me your name?
- Charlie.

199
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,441
{\an8}Charlie, we're gonna get you out of here.

200
00:10:50,442 --> 00:10:52,485
{\an8}I think you're gonna be okay,
but we need to get you inside.

201
00:10:52,486 --> 00:10:54,403
{\an8}- I'm gonna be in so much trouble.
- It was an accident.

202
00:10:54,404 --> 00:10:55,571
{\an8}I don't have my license yet.

203
00:10:55,572 --> 00:10:57,657
{\an8}I snuck out with the car to get boba,
and then I was...

204
00:10:57,658 --> 00:10:59,533
{\an8}Somehow I was in the wrong lane.
Then I was on the freeway.

205
00:10:59,534 --> 00:11:01,118
{\an8}There was a couple guys
hanging from the bridge,

206
00:11:01,119 --> 00:11:02,620
{\an8}and suddenly one fell into my dad's car.

207
00:11:02,621 --> 00:11:03,996
{\an8}What in the hell happened?

208
00:11:03,997 --> 00:11:05,999
{\an8}Bungee jumper off a bridge.
His cord snapped.

209
00:11:07,167 --> 00:11:08,459
{\an8}- [vomits]
- [doctor] Damn it.

210
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:11,295
{\an8}[Ndugu] Hold up. Nobody touch the car
till we can secure his airway.

211
00:11:11,296 --> 00:11:13,047
{\an8}- Is he gonna be okay?
- Kwan, get the kid inside.

212
00:11:13,048 --> 00:11:15,549
{\an8}We need to protect his airway. He'll be
impossible to intubate in this position.

213
00:11:15,550 --> 00:11:17,134
{\an8}Here. Insert this all the way
to the back of his mouth.

214
00:11:17,135 --> 00:11:18,886
{\an8}All right. How do I know
when it's all the way in?

215
00:11:18,887 --> 00:11:20,680
{\an8}You'll feel resistance.

216
00:11:20,681 --> 00:11:21,681
{\an8}- Okay.
- Good.

217
00:11:21,682 --> 00:11:22,766
{\an8}How's she doing?

218
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:26,061
{\an8}She's okay.

219
00:11:27,688 --> 00:11:30,398
{\an8}[Griffith] Wanda Gallagher, 67,
history of DVT.

220
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:31,482
{\an8}Currently on warfarin.

221
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,067
{\an8}Sustained blunt trauma to the neck

222
00:11:33,068 --> 00:11:35,277
{\an8}- after being struck with an object.
- A police baton.

223
00:11:35,278 --> 00:11:37,822
{\an8}I wasn't struck with it.
I kind of ran into it.

224
00:11:37,823 --> 00:11:40,199
{\an8}[Lacey] Because you were resisting arrest
from the Seattle police.

225
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,325
{\an8}She was protesting

226
00:11:41,326 --> 00:11:43,244
{\an8}even though she promised me
she was done with all that

227
00:11:43,245 --> 00:11:45,329
{\an8}after I bailed her out last year
for vandalism.

228
00:11:45,330 --> 00:11:46,914
{\an8}I wasn't resisting arrest.

229
00:11:46,915 --> 00:11:49,834
{\an8}I was trying to separate myself
from the disrupters.

230
00:11:49,835 --> 00:11:53,421
{\an8}They ruin it for the rest of us.
Also, last year was a misunderstanding.

231
00:11:53,422 --> 00:11:56,091
{\an8}Mm-hmm. Passion.
So important in one's life.

232
00:11:56,675 --> 00:11:57,967
{\an8}- [Heron] Dr. Yasuda, plan?
- Mm-hmm.

233
00:11:57,968 --> 00:12:00,177
{\an8}I don't see any hard signs
of vascular injury,

234
00:12:00,178 --> 00:12:05,099
{\an8}but we should run labs to check her INR
and do a cervical CT angio

235
00:12:05,100 --> 00:12:08,728
{\an8}since she is at high risk for bleeding
because of her blood thinners.

236
00:12:08,729 --> 00:12:11,021
{\an8}Bleeding? Mom, this sounds serious.

237
00:12:11,022 --> 00:12:12,940
{\an8}You know what's also serious?

238
00:12:12,941 --> 00:12:15,985
{\an8}The effect of wildfire particles
on a young person's respiratory system.

239
00:12:15,986 --> 00:12:18,612
{\an8}Might as well have 'em start smoking
in elementary school.

240
00:12:18,613 --> 00:12:22,074
{\an8}I'm fighting for my grandchild,
which is more than their mother's doing.

241
00:12:22,075 --> 00:12:23,075
{\an8}I'm growing it.

242
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:25,202
{\an8}And where was this concern
when I was growing up?

243
00:12:25,203 --> 00:12:27,288
{\an8}You worked for one
of the biggest oil companies in the world.

244
00:12:27,289 --> 00:12:29,833
{\an8}I need to go call Michael
and tell him what happened.

245
00:12:30,459 --> 00:12:33,253
{\an8}Excuse me. Unreal.

246
00:12:42,929 --> 00:12:45,723
{\an8}Bailey. You back?

247
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:46,725
{\an8}Shh. Shh.

248
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,893
{\an8}And no.

249
00:12:48,894 --> 00:12:51,188
{\an8}- Then what are you doing?
- None of your business.

250
00:12:52,856 --> 00:12:55,232
{\an8}Okay, wait. I heard
the new residency director started.

251
00:12:55,233 --> 00:12:56,442
{\an8}Have you seen them?

252
00:12:56,443 --> 00:12:57,527
{\an8}[grunts]

253
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:02,948
{\an8}What?

254
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:06,911
{\an8}You remind me of myself
when I was an intern, Dr. Miller.

255
00:13:06,912 --> 00:13:07,829
{\an8}It's Millin.

256
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,664
{\an8}Inquisitive, direct, air of mystery.

257
00:13:10,665 --> 00:13:12,374
{\an8}Always important to...

258
00:13:12,375 --> 00:13:15,044
{\an8}to keep that sense of wonder and awe.
[gasps]

259
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:18,089
{\an8}Miranda Bailey. Come here!

260
00:13:19,299 --> 00:13:22,510
{\an8}- Mmm. Sydney.
- Oh. Oh.

261
00:13:22,511 --> 00:13:23,928
{\an8}Isn't this fun?

262
00:13:23,929 --> 00:13:26,305
{\an8}I mean, a new generation of lady doctors

263
00:13:26,306 --> 00:13:29,809
{\an8}alongside our generation of lady doctors
all working together

264
00:13:29,810 --> 00:13:31,519
{\an8}to make the world a better pla...

265
00:13:31,520 --> 00:13:34,688
{\an8}Oh, Dr. Bailey and I
were co-residents back in the day.

266
00:13:34,689 --> 00:13:37,817
{\an8}And quite competitive, am I right?

267
00:13:37,818 --> 00:13:41,403
{\an8}We had our moments. Uh...

268
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:45,199
{\an8}Oh, look at that. 911 at the clinic.
I better get back.

269
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:48,285
{\an8}Clinic. Look at you doing
the clinic thing again.

270
00:13:48,286 --> 00:13:52,581
{\an8}Good for you. Now, I cannot imagine
being out of the OR,

271
00:13:52,582 --> 00:13:57,002
{\an8}but, hey, if it works for you, great.

272
00:13:57,003 --> 00:13:59,130
{\an8}So, where were we? Oh, yeah.

273
00:13:59,965 --> 00:14:02,883
{\an8}I'm the one that brought you in.
I rearranged whole departments,

274
00:14:02,884 --> 00:14:05,469
{\an8}I fundraised, I hired Nick and Amelia.

275
00:14:05,470 --> 00:14:07,680
{\an8}Well, I was never officially hired.

276
00:14:07,681 --> 00:14:10,766
{\an8}No one asked you to hire Nick.
Nick could've gotten a job anywhere.

277
00:14:10,767 --> 00:14:12,476
{\an8}Well, that's not the point,
and you know it.

278
00:14:12,477 --> 00:14:14,270
{\an8}Okay? This is not just about you
and my mom.

279
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:16,564
{\an8}I brought you in so that I could be a part
of groundbreaking work.

280
00:14:16,565 --> 00:14:18,858
{\an8}If it were just you, that would be okay.
But it isn't.

281
00:14:18,859 --> 00:14:21,151
{\an8}You have no idea
how much you two are alike.

282
00:14:21,152 --> 00:14:23,821
{\an8}Catherine broke more rules than all of us,
but she was strategic about it.

283
00:14:23,822 --> 00:14:25,072
{\an8}She understood how to play the game.

284
00:14:25,073 --> 00:14:26,198
{\an8}I don't have time for games.

285
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:28,909
{\an8}Give Amelia, Owen
and Teddy back their jobs.

286
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:30,578
{\an8}I'll sell a percentage
of my shares of Grey-Sloan,

287
00:14:30,579 --> 00:14:32,079
{\an8}and I can pay you back everything.

288
00:14:32,080 --> 00:14:33,664
{\an8}This isn't about money. Not anymore.

289
00:14:33,665 --> 00:14:36,208
{\an8}I don't know why her ego
should inhibit this work.

290
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,251
{\an8}What about you?

291
00:14:37,252 --> 00:14:39,587
You know how many people
are desperately waiting for help,

292
00:14:39,588 --> 00:14:41,006
and progress takes money.

293
00:14:41,715 --> 00:14:42,716
We have it.

294
00:14:44,467 --> 00:14:46,594
What are you suggesting?
You want my firstborn?

295
00:14:46,595 --> 00:14:49,347
Worse. Apologize.

296
00:14:56,187 --> 00:14:59,523
Charlie Scott, 29,
fell headfirst 30 feet into a windshield.

297
00:14:59,524 --> 00:15:00,566
How is he alive?

298
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:04,737
X-rays show displaced clavicle fracture,
rib fractures,

299
00:15:04,738 --> 00:15:08,782
buckle fracture of the sternum,
bilateral hemothoraxes and a hand injury.

300
00:15:08,783 --> 00:15:12,036
It's like somebody shattered
a crystal vase inside his chest.

301
00:15:12,037 --> 00:15:13,370
All right, Adams, what's our next move?

302
00:15:13,371 --> 00:15:16,040
Bilateral chest tubes and pan-scan him
from head to toe.

303
00:15:16,041 --> 00:15:18,877
You got it.
Let's prep for bilateral thoracostomies.

304
00:15:19,753 --> 00:15:22,838
You... Looks like you have
all your bases covered, okay?

305
00:15:22,839 --> 00:15:24,924
With all due respect,
he has multiple traumatic injuries,

306
00:15:24,925 --> 00:15:26,050
and we're short surgeons.

307
00:15:26,051 --> 00:15:28,178
We need all hands on deck, Chief.

308
00:15:30,305 --> 00:15:32,264
- Where's his right index finger?
- Severed on impact.

309
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:33,766
Adams, do we have the finger?

310
00:15:33,767 --> 00:15:34,892
I have no idea.

311
00:15:34,893 --> 00:15:38,104
Then find it. As a surgeon, you should
know how important a digit is.

312
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:40,690
Give me gloves.

313
00:15:44,694 --> 00:15:46,821
Your heart rate's elevated.

314
00:15:48,698 --> 00:15:50,991
Last time I snuck the car out,
I dented the bumper.

315
00:15:50,992 --> 00:15:52,493
I was grounded for two weeks.

316
00:15:52,494 --> 00:15:54,411
They'll never trust me
behind the wheel again,

317
00:15:54,412 --> 00:15:56,288
which means
I'll never pass my driver's test.

318
00:15:56,289 --> 00:15:57,874
Well, there's always rideshares.

319
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:01,335
You shouldn't be driving
without a license,

320
00:16:01,336 --> 00:16:03,337
but you didn't cause that wreck.

321
00:16:03,338 --> 00:16:04,422
It was an accident.

322
00:16:05,256 --> 00:16:06,424
Happens to the best of us.

323
00:16:07,258 --> 00:16:08,509
Do you have any idea what it's like

324
00:16:08,510 --> 00:16:10,678
to be in your dad's car all by yourself
one moment,

325
00:16:10,679 --> 00:16:14,641
then all of a sudden, bam, someone just
shows up completely blindsiding you?

326
00:16:15,558 --> 00:16:18,979
Have you called your parents?
You have your phone, right?

327
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:24,025
It's in the car still.
Look, I can't go back in there.

328
00:16:25,944 --> 00:16:28,570
We're so sorry, Miss Gallagher.
Radiology's backed up.

329
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:30,656
The protest brought
in a surge of patients.

330
00:16:30,657 --> 00:16:31,574
How is your pain?

331
00:16:31,575 --> 00:16:33,534
Oh, barely feel it. Where's Lacey?

332
00:16:33,535 --> 00:16:35,035
On the phone in the waiting room.

333
00:16:35,036 --> 00:16:37,037
She was always closer to her dad.

334
00:16:37,038 --> 00:16:39,039
Hey, I worked at a pipeline company
for 20 years.

335
00:16:39,040 --> 00:16:41,333
It helped get her to college
but the hours were long.

336
00:16:41,334 --> 00:16:43,669
Didn't allow
for a lot of mother-daughter time.

337
00:16:43,670 --> 00:16:45,212
Do you still work there?

338
00:16:45,213 --> 00:16:46,463
No, I quit ten years ago.

339
00:16:46,464 --> 00:16:49,299
Been an activist ever since.
I worked in the PR department.

340
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:53,053
After the eighth oil leak, I decided
I can't write another press release.

341
00:16:53,054 --> 00:16:55,305
You know, if our hearts were really going
out to the community,

342
00:16:55,306 --> 00:16:57,057
we'd stop spilling the damn stuff.

343
00:16:57,058 --> 00:16:59,184
That's why
I'm on the front lines fighting.

344
00:16:59,185 --> 00:17:02,147
My daughter will never let me meet
my grandbaby if I get arrested again.

345
00:17:03,314 --> 00:17:06,191
Hey, do I have time to go to the bathroom
before my scan?

346
00:17:06,192 --> 00:17:07,110
Sure.

347
00:17:07,694 --> 00:17:09,487
- I'll show you where it is.
- Thank you.

348
00:17:10,196 --> 00:17:14,033
So, you can't imagine doing good things
for people?

349
00:17:14,034 --> 00:17:16,118
Then you don't get to be a doctor.

350
00:17:16,119 --> 00:17:19,705
Now, I'll tell you what you need to get...
Where are the damn urinary cups?

351
00:17:19,706 --> 00:17:21,623
Bed four is all checked in.

352
00:17:21,624 --> 00:17:23,000
Should I tell them you'll be there

353
00:17:23,001 --> 00:17:26,003
after you've taken your anger out
on these gauze pads?

354
00:17:26,004 --> 00:17:29,173
Her philosophy is to "heal with love."

355
00:17:29,174 --> 00:17:33,844
Love does not heal. Science heals.
Medicine and trained doctors heal.

356
00:17:33,845 --> 00:17:36,097
100%. What are we talking about?

357
00:17:37,015 --> 00:17:40,018
Richard replaced me with Sydney Heron.

358
00:17:40,769 --> 00:17:43,103
Sydney Heron.
We were in the same residency class.

359
00:17:43,104 --> 00:17:45,939
She took my interns when I was pregnant
and slowed them down

360
00:17:45,940 --> 00:17:50,069
with positivity and smiles
and-and-and butterflies.

361
00:17:50,070 --> 00:17:51,779
Sounds evil?

362
00:17:51,780 --> 00:17:54,740
I am the one that got those residents
back into shape.

363
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:59,745
I went on to be chief resident,
and I stayed to be an attending here

364
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:01,706
while she took a job in Florida.

365
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:04,958
Florida.

366
00:18:04,959 --> 00:18:06,794
But you've got your clinic
and your research ideas...

367
00:18:06,795 --> 00:18:08,922
Don't throw my words back at me,
Ben Warren.

368
00:18:12,509 --> 00:18:15,220
Ndugu's doing a quick consult.
He'll meet us in CT.

369
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:18,055
I'm surprised to see you with us, Schmitt.

370
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,724
You've been spending most of your time
with Dr. Beltran.

371
00:18:20,725 --> 00:18:25,688
Uh, right.
I actually might be reassessing peds.

372
00:18:26,356 --> 00:18:27,315
Reassessing?

373
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,110
I might wanna keep my options open
for a bit.

374
00:18:30,693 --> 00:18:32,695
Maybe stay in general surgery like you.

375
00:18:33,404 --> 00:18:36,615
Schmitt, you're a fifth year
and a chief resident.

376
00:18:36,616 --> 00:18:39,911
You need to be clear on what you want
or no one's gonna take you seriously.

377
00:18:40,495 --> 00:18:43,705
Understood. Sir, I just...
I wanna make sure that I...

378
00:18:43,706 --> 00:18:45,707
[machine beeps]

379
00:18:45,708 --> 00:18:47,377
The left chest is full of blood.

380
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:49,920
He's getting more hypotensive and tachy.

381
00:18:49,921 --> 00:18:52,507
We're gonna take him straight to the OR.
I'll page Ndugu on the way.

382
00:19:02,183 --> 00:19:05,102
Excuse me. There are two police officers
in the exam room.

383
00:19:05,103 --> 00:19:06,395
They want to speak to my mom.

384
00:19:06,396 --> 00:19:08,605
After she's done in the bathroom,
we'll take her to radiology.

385
00:19:08,606 --> 00:19:11,108
- They can speak to her after that.
- Did her results come back?

386
00:19:11,109 --> 00:19:13,652
According to her labs,
her blood is clotting too slowly,

387
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,737
so we would like to admit her
for observation,

388
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:17,698
and she should really speak
to her primary doctor

389
00:19:17,699 --> 00:19:20,409
- about managing her blood thinners.
- Good luck.

390
00:19:20,410 --> 00:19:23,412
My mom is more concerned with Puget Sound
and its population of zooplankton

391
00:19:23,413 --> 00:19:24,372
than her own health.

392
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:26,291
Well, she's not wrong.
It's what the salmon eat.

393
00:19:26,916 --> 00:19:28,751
It's like a whole thing. I read about it.

394
00:19:29,377 --> 00:19:30,712
How long has she been in the bathroom?

395
00:19:33,923 --> 00:19:37,927
- Mom? Mom? Are you okay?
- Miss Gallagher?

396
00:19:39,262 --> 00:19:41,973
She couldn't have just disappeared.

397
00:19:43,641 --> 00:19:47,228
Or maybe she could have.

398
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,231
She climbed into the ceiling?

399
00:19:58,531 --> 00:20:02,660
Your assistant isn't at her desk.
I'm sure she'd call security.

400
00:20:04,495 --> 00:20:06,998
I'm here out of respect for Jackson.

401
00:20:07,790 --> 00:20:09,708
Catherine? Catherine.

402
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,920
Damn it! Catherine.

403
00:20:12,545 --> 00:20:13,963
Catherine.

404
00:20:14,881 --> 00:20:16,049
Catherine.

405
00:20:24,641 --> 00:20:25,974
Why aren't you in the OR?

406
00:20:25,975 --> 00:20:29,102
Because I'm looking for
our patient's finger. Index, right hand.

407
00:20:29,103 --> 00:20:31,897
I can't believe the guy who lost a digit
scored higher on the ABSITE than me.

408
00:20:31,898 --> 00:20:33,649
I didn't lose it.

409
00:20:33,650 --> 00:20:36,652
Our patient did when he busted through
the windshield. Help me look.

410
00:20:36,653 --> 00:20:39,154
- Can't. Looking for Ian's phone.
- Finger trumps phone.

411
00:20:39,155 --> 00:20:40,239
I'll give you a finger.

412
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:43,033
Have you always been an ass
or did it start when that girl left you?

413
00:20:43,034 --> 00:20:46,703
- What are you talking about?
- Your fiancée. Molly, right?

414
00:20:46,704 --> 00:20:48,998
Ex-fiancée, and she didn't leave me.

415
00:20:49,958 --> 00:20:51,417
You know what?
Forget I ever said anything.

416
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:55,046
Uh-huh.

417
00:20:58,132 --> 00:20:59,384
Bye, loser.

418
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,887
We've tried to track all the different
routes she could have taken,

419
00:21:03,888 --> 00:21:06,932
but security will only allow maintenance
in the ceiling. So, when...

420
00:21:06,933 --> 00:21:08,308
So, are they in the ceiling looking?

421
00:21:08,309 --> 00:21:10,644
What exactly is the protocol?

422
00:21:10,645 --> 00:21:12,397
Patients usually stay on the ground.

423
00:21:13,022 --> 00:21:18,110
Lacey, Lacey, I want... I want you
to try to stay calm, okay?

424
00:21:18,111 --> 00:21:19,028
Mmm.

425
00:21:19,029 --> 00:21:21,197
Okay? Let's keep that baby safe, right?

426
00:21:21,823 --> 00:21:24,408
So what they are trying to say
is there is no protocol

427
00:21:24,409 --> 00:21:25,784
because this has never happened before,

428
00:21:25,785 --> 00:21:31,040
which is strange because odd things
often happen here, but we will find her.

429
00:21:31,708 --> 00:21:34,335
So, take a seat. Deep breaths, yeah?

430
00:21:36,629 --> 00:21:38,172
Yeah. Great.

431
00:21:42,343 --> 00:21:43,552
Okay.

432
00:21:43,553 --> 00:21:44,720
- Now...
- We're gonna keep looking.

433
00:21:44,721 --> 00:21:46,388
- I think I'm gonna go to the roof.
- Wow.

434
00:21:46,389 --> 00:21:48,515
Who else was nervous
about her going into labor?

435
00:21:48,516 --> 00:21:52,270
It's just what we need, right? A baby
in the lobby and Grandma in the ceiling.

436
00:21:52,854 --> 00:21:56,315
So I'm gonna forward you the,
uh, hospital blueprint I received,

437
00:21:56,316 --> 00:21:58,651
and also
I issued a hospital-wide alert. So...

438
00:21:59,277 --> 00:22:02,362
That's it? You're not gonna get mad
or yell at us?

439
00:22:02,363 --> 00:22:05,450
Yell? Oh, how silly. No. Hop to it.

440
00:22:07,076 --> 00:22:08,201
I preferred yelling.

441
00:22:08,202 --> 00:22:09,495
Obviously.

442
00:22:12,040 --> 00:22:15,167
I don't see how gluing yourself to a train

443
00:22:15,168 --> 00:22:17,878
or blocking a bridge will save us
from climate change.

444
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:20,964
You tell that to the people who marched
across the Edmund Pettus Bridge

445
00:22:20,965 --> 00:22:22,174
for civil rights.

446
00:22:22,175 --> 00:22:23,258
GIA stapler, BokHee.

447
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:25,886
That is a compelling point,
and I apologize.

448
00:22:25,887 --> 00:22:27,846
Research has shown that
a lot of childhood diseases

449
00:22:27,847 --> 00:22:30,098
could have been caused
by some kind of environmental exposure.

450
00:22:30,099 --> 00:22:31,850
Contaminants, pesticides, solvents.

451
00:22:31,851 --> 00:22:34,144
We have the solution
to prevent pain and loss,

452
00:22:34,145 --> 00:22:36,855
but instead, we just keep making it worse.

453
00:22:36,856 --> 00:22:37,939
I apologize again.

454
00:22:37,940 --> 00:22:39,816
All right,
we've stapled the lung bleeders,

455
00:22:39,817 --> 00:22:42,277
ligated the intercostal artery,
even clamped the hilum.

456
00:22:42,278 --> 00:22:44,321
He's still bleeding.
Where's it coming from?

457
00:22:44,322 --> 00:22:46,114
It must be venous. Coming from above.

458
00:22:46,115 --> 00:22:48,116
- The subclavian?
- No, that's too far north.

459
00:22:48,117 --> 00:22:50,661
The displaced clavicle fracture
could've injured it.

460
00:22:51,662 --> 00:22:52,788
All right, fine. Let's check.

461
00:22:52,789 --> 00:22:55,290
Okay, Schmitt. Let's retract the lung out
of the way, so we can see.

462
00:22:55,291 --> 00:22:56,417
Okay.

463
00:22:57,168 --> 00:22:59,503
Look there. See that break in the pleura?

464
00:22:59,504 --> 00:23:01,630
Then it must be the subclavian vein.

465
00:23:01,631 --> 00:23:02,923
All right.

466
00:23:02,924 --> 00:23:04,132
Um, clamp. Let's ligate.

467
00:23:04,133 --> 00:23:05,801
No, no, you won't get enough access here.

468
00:23:05,802 --> 00:23:08,136
You're gonna have to do
a subclavian incision higher up.

469
00:23:08,137 --> 00:23:10,514
The patient's bleeding out.
I'm not doing another incision.

470
00:23:10,515 --> 00:23:11,974
Clamp. Now.

471
00:23:15,645 --> 00:23:17,729
Damn it. I can't get full visualization.

472
00:23:17,730 --> 00:23:20,483
Like I said.
It's impossible from that approach.

473
00:23:23,528 --> 00:23:25,529
I'll do a subclavian incision,
but we need to move fast.

474
00:23:25,530 --> 00:23:27,406
I need everyone's help
resecting the clavicle.

475
00:23:27,407 --> 00:23:29,075
So, let's pack him and reposition.

476
00:23:33,704 --> 00:23:34,704
Mmm.

477
00:23:34,705 --> 00:23:36,082
Are you in any pain?

478
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,625
What happened?

479
00:23:38,626 --> 00:23:39,918
You collapsed.

480
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:43,213
CT shows subacute Budd-Chiari syndrome.

481
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:45,924
You have a blood clot
in your hepatic vein and IVC

482
00:23:45,925 --> 00:23:48,636
due to the hypercoagulable state
of your cancer.

483
00:23:50,388 --> 00:23:52,848
Did you call Jackson or Richard?

484
00:23:52,849 --> 00:23:53,932
Not yet.

485
00:23:53,933 --> 00:23:55,226
Okay then.

486
00:23:55,726 --> 00:23:57,645
I need to start you on anticoagulation.

487
00:23:58,729 --> 00:23:59,938
I wanna start heparin drip.

488
00:23:59,939 --> 00:24:02,357
Then we'll run some tests
and do some more labs

489
00:24:02,358 --> 00:24:04,651
and see if you're a candidate
for a TIPS procedure.

490
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:06,903
You'll do heparin only. Nothing more.

491
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:10,241
I'm not pursuing any invasive treatments.

492
00:24:10,825 --> 00:24:12,159
You could go into liver failure.

493
00:24:12,160 --> 00:24:13,243
I know.

494
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:15,913
What about the tumor on your spine?
Do you know about that?

495
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:17,539
I saw it on your scans.

496
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,292
I do know about it.

497
00:24:19,876 --> 00:24:21,543
But Richard and Jackson don't.

498
00:24:21,544 --> 00:24:23,880
And you're not going to tell them.

499
00:24:27,008 --> 00:24:28,383
Hey. Heron paged me,

500
00:24:28,384 --> 00:24:30,511
said you needed help
looking for a patient.

501
00:24:31,095 --> 00:24:32,054
It's okay.

502
00:24:33,097 --> 00:24:34,098
I get it.

503
00:24:34,599 --> 00:24:35,765
What?

504
00:24:35,766 --> 00:24:36,851
Chicago.

505
00:24:38,394 --> 00:24:39,644
You should go.

506
00:24:39,645 --> 00:24:41,730
Whatever you and I are or were...

507
00:24:41,731 --> 00:24:43,608
Security thinks she went south.

508
00:24:45,943 --> 00:24:47,736
Not-Bailey said a patient
was in the ceiling.

509
00:24:47,737 --> 00:24:50,030
Please tell me
there's a translation for that.

510
00:24:50,031 --> 00:24:51,198
There is a patient in the ceiling.

511
00:24:51,199 --> 00:24:54,326
I've spent my entire day looking
for people and fingers.

512
00:24:54,327 --> 00:24:55,535
Millin probably digs Heron.

513
00:24:55,536 --> 00:24:56,620
Why would you say that?

514
00:24:56,621 --> 00:24:59,414
Well, she heals with love.
Probably meditates. She's untraditional.

515
00:24:59,415 --> 00:25:02,626
No, she touched my hair.
No one should touch hair.

516
00:25:02,627 --> 00:25:03,919
- I miss Bailey.
- Me too.

517
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:06,546
Adams got us into this mess.
Bailey was standing up for him, and he...

518
00:25:06,547 --> 00:25:09,674
No way. She was standing up for all of us,
and I never asked anyone to do that.

519
00:25:09,675 --> 00:25:11,718
- Well, Griffith did...
- Can everyone just shut up

520
00:25:11,719 --> 00:25:13,137
and find the patient?

521
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,138
It'll go faster if we split up.

522
00:25:15,139 --> 00:25:16,724
Get brooms.

523
00:25:28,528 --> 00:25:31,071
Griffith, I've worked at this hospital
long enough to know,

524
00:25:31,072 --> 00:25:34,742
hardly anyone uses this closet,
and nothing I'm taking will be missed.

525
00:25:35,326 --> 00:25:38,495
- We lost a patient.
- Well, losses come with the job.

526
00:25:38,496 --> 00:25:41,832
No, no, no. She's not dead.
We literally don't know where she is.

527
00:25:42,917 --> 00:25:45,169
Not my problem anymore.

528
00:25:47,505 --> 00:25:48,506
It should be.

529
00:25:51,842 --> 00:25:53,385
Why aren't you fighting for your job?

530
00:25:53,386 --> 00:25:56,721
Is it that easy to leave after everything
you've been through with us?

531
00:25:56,722 --> 00:26:00,767
Why aren't you banging on doors? Yelling?
I thought you believed in us. I thought...

532
00:26:00,768 --> 00:26:02,185
[banging]

533
00:26:02,186 --> 00:26:03,603
[Wanda] Hello? Excuse me?

534
00:26:03,604 --> 00:26:04,688
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, hell no.

535
00:26:04,689 --> 00:26:08,067
- [Wanda] Hello? Little help, please.
- [banging]

536
00:26:12,196 --> 00:26:14,030
- Security's on their way.
- What'd they say?

537
00:26:14,031 --> 00:26:15,282
They mostly laughed.

538
00:26:15,283 --> 00:26:18,702
[Wanda] I'm so sorry. I just...
I-I saw the police, and I got so nervous

539
00:26:18,703 --> 00:26:21,246
and I thought that vent
would lead straight to the next room,

540
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,164
but then I fell over something in the dark

541
00:26:23,165 --> 00:26:24,749
and I landed trapped between the walls.

542
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:26,626
Okay. We're getting help, Wanda.
Just hang in tight.

543
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:28,378
[Wanda] Okay. I just...
I really need to pee.

544
00:26:28,379 --> 00:26:30,088
And it's getting harder to breathe.

545
00:26:30,089 --> 00:26:32,382
- Ooh, are you claustrophobic?
- She could be bleeding.

546
00:26:32,383 --> 00:26:33,592
- Her neck is...
- What?

547
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:36,094
She sustained blunt trauma to the neck.
She had a small contusion.

548
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,096
She disappeared
before we were able to scan her.

549
00:26:38,097 --> 00:26:40,432
She's on blood thinners
from a history of DVT.

550
00:26:40,433 --> 00:26:43,810
Okay, expanding neck hematoma
could be closing her airway.

551
00:26:43,811 --> 00:26:46,771
- [crashes]
- Wanda? Wanda, say something!

552
00:26:46,772 --> 00:26:47,939
- Oh, my God.
- [Bailey] Damn it.

553
00:26:47,940 --> 00:26:49,899
Hey, Millin, get a crash cart.

554
00:26:49,900 --> 00:26:51,527
- Yasuda, get maintenance. Now.
- Yeah.

555
00:26:52,361 --> 00:26:54,488
- What is... Oh.
- [Griffith] Wanda?

556
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:56,239
Wanda, can you hear me?

557
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:58,159
Oh, good, good, good.

558
00:26:58,826 --> 00:27:00,870
Okay. Get out of the way.
Get out of the way.

559
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,334
You know, you really don't have to wait
with me, Dr. Grey.

560
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:11,839
Okay. Well, then I should just go tell
Jackson to watch your heparin drip.

561
00:27:12,632 --> 00:27:14,216
Richard should know too.

562
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:16,509
I'll tell them when I'm ready.

563
00:27:16,510 --> 00:27:17,595
When will that be?

564
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:19,304
When your liver fails?

565
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,598
- [scoffs]
- Or when you need a transplant?

566
00:27:21,599 --> 00:27:24,351
What late-stage cancer patient
gets a new liver, hmm?

567
00:27:24,352 --> 00:27:27,604
Which is why you should consider
letting me do the surgery for this clot.

568
00:27:27,605 --> 00:27:30,565
Could we just let the heparin
have a chance to work, please?

569
00:27:30,566 --> 00:27:33,069
It would not hurt to think ahead.

570
00:27:34,236 --> 00:27:37,572
Do you know how much work
planning for your own death is?

571
00:27:37,573 --> 00:27:41,034
And I'm not just talking about picking out
a casket or making out a will.

572
00:27:41,035 --> 00:27:43,203
I'm talking about taking stock
in your life

573
00:27:43,204 --> 00:27:45,289
and making sure you've done everything
you wanna do with it.

574
00:27:45,873 --> 00:27:47,624
I think about this every day.

575
00:27:47,625 --> 00:27:49,877
And when I do,
there's two things that I know.

576
00:27:50,878 --> 00:27:53,714
My family is perfect,
especially my grandbaby,

577
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:57,801
and I'm not ready to sit on the sidelines.

578
00:27:57,802 --> 00:28:00,595
Catherine Fox,
you have had an extraordinary career.

579
00:28:00,596 --> 00:28:03,683
What more do you want?

580
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:08,019
The more surgeries
and invasive procedures I get,

581
00:28:08,020 --> 00:28:09,854
the more they define who I am.

582
00:28:09,855 --> 00:28:11,690
I want people to remember my name

583
00:28:11,691 --> 00:28:14,192
because of the advances I've made
in medicine,

584
00:28:14,193 --> 00:28:16,486
for the risks that I've taken
to save lives,

585
00:28:16,487 --> 00:28:18,238
for the firsts that I have achieved.

586
00:28:18,239 --> 00:28:22,410
I would think you of all people
would understand that.

587
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:25,328
So keep your mouth shut.

588
00:28:25,329 --> 00:28:26,497
And what if I don't?

589
00:28:26,997 --> 00:28:30,166
Then you and your friends
will never get your jobs back.

590
00:28:30,167 --> 00:28:32,128
You're threatening me over your health?

591
00:28:33,003 --> 00:28:36,424
I've blackmailed people over far less.

592
00:28:38,551 --> 00:28:40,009
[Yasuda] Can you see her yet?

593
00:28:40,010 --> 00:28:42,346
- [Bailey] What the heck.
- I've got the crash cart.

594
00:28:43,597 --> 00:28:45,474
Oh, I see her.

595
00:28:46,726 --> 00:28:49,394
Uh, she's unconscious.
Okay. Okay. We gotta go.

596
00:28:49,395 --> 00:28:50,521
Come on. Come on.

597
00:28:51,480 --> 00:28:53,399
- All right.
- We're coming, Wanda!

598
00:28:55,025 --> 00:28:56,109
Maintenance is here!

599
00:28:56,110 --> 00:28:57,694
Come on. Let's go.

600
00:28:57,695 --> 00:28:59,363
Hi, she's down here.

601
00:29:03,993 --> 00:29:06,369
Is he okay? The guy's... I don't know.

602
00:29:06,370 --> 00:29:07,954
Is his family here yet?

603
00:29:07,955 --> 00:29:10,207
I'm not sure, but I can check.

604
00:29:11,625 --> 00:29:13,793
I just made
the junior varsity tennis team,

605
00:29:13,794 --> 00:29:15,254
and we have a match on Wednesday.

606
00:29:16,213 --> 00:29:18,007
Sophomore formal is on Saturday.

607
00:29:19,592 --> 00:29:20,884
But this guy might not live.

608
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:25,181
And I... I can't do anything ever again
if he can't.

609
00:29:26,891 --> 00:29:28,933
You can. You'll pick up the racket,

610
00:29:28,934 --> 00:29:31,019
put on the suit
or get behind the wheel again.

611
00:29:31,020 --> 00:29:32,938
And you'll put one foot
in front of the other.

612
00:29:34,523 --> 00:29:36,150
And it'll suck for a while,

613
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:40,362
but eventually, it'll suck less.

614
00:29:41,113 --> 00:29:42,782
Look, I know it sounds cold,

615
00:29:43,824 --> 00:29:44,867
but it's life.

616
00:29:47,870 --> 00:29:49,162
You really think that?

617
00:29:49,163 --> 00:29:51,207
I... do.

618
00:29:58,088 --> 00:29:59,965
Good. Thank you.

619
00:30:00,841 --> 00:30:02,091
Pulse is weak, but it's there.

620
00:30:02,092 --> 00:30:04,219
Okay, she needs an airway right now.

621
00:30:04,220 --> 00:30:05,679
- Tube, please.
- On it.

622
00:30:06,639 --> 00:30:08,015
- All right. Thank you.
- Here you go.

623
00:30:10,059 --> 00:30:11,060
Good. Good. Good.

624
00:30:12,269 --> 00:30:13,728
Come on. Come on. Damn it.

625
00:30:13,729 --> 00:30:15,897
It's too much compression,
I won't be able to get it in.

626
00:30:15,898 --> 00:30:19,150
We need to decompress the hematoma.
Millin, Betadine.

627
00:30:19,151 --> 00:30:21,528
Griffith, be ready to pack the wound.

628
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:22,905
Yasuda, oxygen.

629
00:30:23,823 --> 00:30:24,989
Scalpel.

630
00:30:24,990 --> 00:30:26,200
We're ready?

631
00:30:33,082 --> 00:30:34,083
Oh, goodness.

632
00:30:36,836 --> 00:30:38,212
- Okay, let's pack.
- Okay.

633
00:30:39,380 --> 00:30:41,090
[Bailey] We need to get her to an OR.

634
00:30:41,966 --> 00:30:44,008
[Ndugu] He's getting too hypotensive.
We need to move faster.

635
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:45,678
[Lincoln] All right.
Removing the clavicle.

636
00:30:47,179 --> 00:30:49,765
[Ndugu] All right. All right.
I see the injury. Clamp.

637
00:30:52,268 --> 00:30:53,519
Here we go.

638
00:30:54,770 --> 00:30:56,312
All right. Bleeding stopped.

639
00:30:56,313 --> 00:30:59,024
We've got proximal vascular control.
5-0 Prolene.

640
00:31:01,443 --> 00:31:03,988
Dr. Webber, you caught the bleed.
Why don't you do the honors?

641
00:31:04,905 --> 00:31:06,573
No. Go ahead. You're already there.

642
00:31:06,574 --> 00:31:07,741
No, I insist.

643
00:31:15,624 --> 00:31:18,002
You wanna stay
in general surgery, Schmitt?

644
00:31:18,586 --> 00:31:19,837
It's time to step up.

645
00:31:21,505 --> 00:31:22,506
Let's do it.

646
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:24,465
I found the finger.

647
00:31:24,466 --> 00:31:26,593
Well, Kwan did, but it's here.

648
00:31:26,594 --> 00:31:28,721
- Keep going, Schmitt.
- It's too late.

649
00:31:33,267 --> 00:31:34,267
Let's go.

650
00:31:34,268 --> 00:31:36,895
Hey, we had to decompress the hematoma.

651
00:31:36,896 --> 00:31:39,355
Her sats have been increasing
over the last three minutes,

652
00:31:39,356 --> 00:31:42,650
but she needs a formal neck exploration
and closure in the OR.

653
00:31:42,651 --> 00:31:44,444
- Okay. We're headed straight there.
- Yep.

654
00:31:44,445 --> 00:31:46,863
Special thanks for helping
my interns, Miranda.

655
00:31:46,864 --> 00:31:49,158
Yeah, you can go now.
Yeah. I got it from here.

656
00:32:11,013 --> 00:32:12,222
I'm sorry about the planet.

657
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,684
Sorry about your ABSITE.

658
00:32:16,268 --> 00:32:17,311
Damn it, Jo.

659
00:32:19,188 --> 00:32:20,230
Kyler Murray.

660
00:32:20,856 --> 00:32:23,901
Ninth overall pick
in the 2018 draft by the A's.

661
00:32:24,485 --> 00:32:26,153
Top left fielder, but also

662
00:32:27,154 --> 00:32:30,783
the number one overall pick
for the Arizona Cardinals.

663
00:32:32,242 --> 00:32:33,327
Cardinals is football.

664
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,287
- Okay.
- Okay, um.

665
00:32:36,288 --> 00:32:38,498
Take quidditch.

666
00:32:38,499 --> 00:32:39,958
Harry. He's the seeker,

667
00:32:39,959 --> 00:32:42,836
but there's no reason
he couldn't also be a chaser.

668
00:32:43,545 --> 00:32:45,630
They all fly brooms.
They all train the same way.

669
00:32:45,631 --> 00:32:49,385
He might not even know yet if he has
the skills to try a different position.

670
00:32:51,720 --> 00:32:53,346
You're gonna be a good dad.

671
00:32:53,347 --> 00:32:54,806
I already am.

672
00:32:54,807 --> 00:32:56,100
That's what I meant.

673
00:33:05,359 --> 00:33:07,403
Hey, were you able to reattach it?

674
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:11,407
It'd been too long.
Lincoln just closed the wound with a flap.

675
00:33:13,909 --> 00:33:15,244
She saved me.

676
00:33:18,038 --> 00:33:19,081
Molly.

677
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:25,879
When my mom was sick,
I was drowning in grief,

678
00:33:27,172 --> 00:33:28,465
and she pulled me out of it.

679
00:33:29,633 --> 00:33:32,511
One day we got into an ugly fight,

680
00:33:34,221 --> 00:33:36,724
and before I knew it, she drove away.

681
00:33:38,183 --> 00:33:41,603
Sh-She didn't even make it to the highway
before she was hit by a reckless driver.

682
00:33:43,856 --> 00:33:45,983
And just like that,

683
00:33:47,484 --> 00:33:48,944
I was a stranger.

684
00:33:51,739 --> 00:33:52,740
And I...

685
00:33:54,658 --> 00:33:55,826
I couldn't stay.

686
00:33:58,120 --> 00:33:59,121
I'm sorry.

687
00:34:00,789 --> 00:34:01,790
Yeah.

688
00:34:03,167 --> 00:34:04,168
Me too.

689
00:34:22,936 --> 00:34:23,936
Is she gonna be okay?

690
00:34:23,937 --> 00:34:25,021
She is.

691
00:34:25,022 --> 00:34:27,191
We found the source
of the bleeding and stopped it.

692
00:34:27,983 --> 00:34:30,986
We'll go over her recovery with her
in the morning, if you'd like to join.

693
00:34:31,695 --> 00:34:32,696
Yeah.

694
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:43,040
You almost got yourself killed again.

695
00:34:44,500 --> 00:34:45,959
You climbed into a ceiling.

696
00:34:48,170 --> 00:34:50,631
I don't wanna talk about this right now.

697
00:34:51,215 --> 00:34:52,299
[Lacey] Of course you don't.

698
00:34:53,592 --> 00:34:57,638
You march on bridges and scream at CEOs
and fight fossil fuels,

699
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:00,974
but you won't even talk
to your own daughter.

700
00:35:03,393 --> 00:35:05,978
I know you're trying to make up
for what you did in the past,

701
00:35:05,979 --> 00:35:07,856
but that should include me too.

702
00:35:08,857 --> 00:35:10,943
You want a relationship
with your granddaughter.

703
00:35:12,486 --> 00:35:15,280
Well, I wanted a relationship
with my mother.

704
00:35:31,421 --> 00:35:32,713
Wanda's in the ICU.

705
00:35:32,714 --> 00:35:34,173
Her wound exploration was simple.

706
00:35:34,174 --> 00:35:38,470
We irrigated, ligated
and Dr. Heron let me close.

707
00:35:39,179 --> 00:35:40,180
How nice.

708
00:35:43,976 --> 00:35:45,394
[Bailey] And I did fight.

709
00:35:46,436 --> 00:35:49,940
Putting my job on the line for all of you,
that was me fighting.

710
00:35:51,733 --> 00:35:53,277
What happened, it's not your fault.

711
00:35:53,861 --> 00:35:57,739
And you can't carry
everyone else's choices on your shoulders.

712
00:35:59,241 --> 00:36:00,242
Hey,

713
00:36:01,743 --> 00:36:03,203
you always know where to find me.

714
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,805
What's with the urgent text?

715
00:36:22,806 --> 00:36:26,018
Uh, I wanted to go over Charlie's surgery
with you again. Step by step.

716
00:36:26,935 --> 00:36:28,352
Did something happen? Is he okay?

717
00:36:28,353 --> 00:36:30,105
No, he's fine. He's still stable.

718
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,690
Sorry, I should've led with that.

719
00:36:32,691 --> 00:36:33,775
No kidding.

720
00:36:34,693 --> 00:36:38,654
Look, I gave the vascular repair
to Schmitt because I didn't feel up to it.

721
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:41,950
And I haven't decided anything
about my future in the OR yet.

722
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:47,748
But I just don't have it in me
to do a skills assessment tonight.

723
00:36:48,332 --> 00:36:50,667
Well, this isn't for you. This is for me.

724
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,253
We both know I was trained by the best,

725
00:36:54,254 --> 00:36:57,674
but I've been taught to operate
within a very specific specialty.

726
00:36:58,258 --> 00:37:01,135
And today, when something outside
of that field went wrong,

727
00:37:01,136 --> 00:37:03,722
I didn't step back to look
at the whole picture.

728
00:37:04,306 --> 00:37:06,390
I want you to take me through it all again

729
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,728
and show me what I missed
and why we fixed it the way we did.

730
00:37:10,604 --> 00:37:14,191
Well, they taught surgery
quite differently when I trained.

731
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:16,485
This could take a while.

732
00:37:17,861 --> 00:37:19,363
I got all night.

733
00:37:20,113 --> 00:37:21,615
- Show me what you have.
- All right.

734
00:37:25,202 --> 00:37:26,994
Oh, here you all are.

735
00:37:26,995 --> 00:37:30,249
In the best room in the hospital.
The room for improvement.

736
00:37:31,917 --> 00:37:35,920
Get some rest. And I will see you bright
and early tomorrow morning, 6:00 a.m.

737
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:38,090
The early bird does get the worm.

738
00:37:39,967 --> 00:37:41,426
[both groan]

739
00:37:42,135 --> 00:37:44,220
I need a drink. Anyone?

740
00:37:44,221 --> 00:37:45,430
I need to make a call.

741
00:37:54,356 --> 00:37:56,066
I don't wanna get stuck in a wall.

742
00:38:00,195 --> 00:38:03,614
Is that your way of saying
we need to talk about what happened?

743
00:38:03,615 --> 00:38:04,699
What almost happened.

744
00:38:04,700 --> 00:38:05,867
Okay. What almost happened.

745
00:38:07,119 --> 00:38:09,161
- I think a patient died.
- Mm-hmm.

746
00:38:09,162 --> 00:38:10,664
- We were upset.
- Mm-hmm.

747
00:38:11,581 --> 00:38:13,874
And we had a moment
where we felt terrible,

748
00:38:13,875 --> 00:38:16,168
- and we were just trying to...
- Not feel terrible.

749
00:38:16,169 --> 00:38:17,629
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

750
00:38:18,755 --> 00:38:19,881
Friends?

751
00:38:54,458 --> 00:38:56,792
I almost told him twice today.

752
00:38:56,793 --> 00:38:59,211
You have to tell him.
I'm not raising this baby with you.

753
00:38:59,212 --> 00:39:02,882
Shut up. I've been puking all day.

754
00:39:02,883 --> 00:39:06,761
It's all gone.
All the crackers and fluids and dignity.

755
00:39:06,762 --> 00:39:07,845
It's all down the toilet.

756
00:39:07,846 --> 00:39:09,222
Okay. We need a safe word

757
00:39:09,723 --> 00:39:13,059
for the next nine months
for when you get too graphic or mean.

758
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:16,145
Like, "jelly beans"
or "disinfectant" or something.

759
00:39:16,146 --> 00:39:18,564
We need to put a limit
on how much you can talk.

760
00:39:18,565 --> 00:39:19,982
Why are you in a good mood?

761
00:39:19,983 --> 00:39:22,485
I need you to be miserable with me.
Think about peds.

762
00:39:22,486 --> 00:39:24,278
No. I'm gonna think about quidditch.

763
00:39:24,279 --> 00:39:27,823
- Hmm?
- I might find a new path. Or not.

764
00:39:27,824 --> 00:39:31,078
For all I know, I might be
some other specialty's secret weapon.

765
00:39:32,496 --> 00:39:34,247
Quidditch. What?

766
00:39:39,294 --> 00:39:41,129
I thought that dude was eyeing Schmitt.

767
00:39:42,172 --> 00:39:43,548
Good for him.

768
00:39:45,342 --> 00:39:46,510
You're turning down fries

769
00:39:47,052 --> 00:39:49,388
and wine...

770
00:39:54,643 --> 00:39:55,644
Are you?

771
00:39:56,353 --> 00:39:57,354
Are we?

772
00:39:57,938 --> 00:39:59,147
Yep.

773
00:40:02,484 --> 00:40:03,485
[laughs] Oh, my God.

774
00:40:04,027 --> 00:40:05,320
[both laugh]

775
00:40:06,113 --> 00:40:07,114
God.

776
00:40:08,698 --> 00:40:10,950
[Grey] <i>If you do the work,
you can train yourself</i>

777
00:40:10,951 --> 00:40:13,412
<i>to hold anything inside
without negative consequences.</i>

778
00:40:18,083 --> 00:40:21,585
My shift is over. If you need something,
the staff can help you inside.

779
00:40:21,586 --> 00:40:24,423
I... I've spent the past few years
putting together memories.

780
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:26,382
Trying to rebuild my life

781
00:40:26,383 --> 00:40:28,802
so I could know who I am
and who I'm supposed to be.

782
00:40:29,678 --> 00:40:31,138
You know, but after everything,

783
00:40:32,514 --> 00:40:34,683
I've always felt like something
was still missing.

784
00:40:36,893 --> 00:40:37,894
[Kwan stammers]

785
00:40:40,397 --> 00:40:41,440
I mean, this is you.

786
00:40:43,733 --> 00:40:46,110
<i>But most people don't have that discipline</i>

787
00:40:46,111 --> 00:40:47,195
<i>or time.</i>

788
00:40:49,239 --> 00:40:52,492
<i>They just bury it inside
and hope it stays there.</i>

789
00:40:54,411 --> 00:40:55,412
Hey.

790
00:40:56,663 --> 00:40:58,497
You should apply to Grey-Sloan.

791
00:40:58,498 --> 00:41:03,170
Mm-hmm. I built a world-class program,
and you deserve to be in it.

792
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:06,423
- Even without you?
- No.

793
00:41:07,299 --> 00:41:08,884
'Cause I'm getting my job back.

794
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:12,971
- <i>Don't do it.</i>
- [knocking]

795
00:41:13,555 --> 00:41:15,848
- <i>Let it out. Be loud.</i>
- [knocking continues]

796
00:41:15,849 --> 00:41:17,100
Yeah, I'm coming.

797
00:41:17,642 --> 00:41:18,935
I swear to God.

798
00:41:22,147 --> 00:41:23,147
Hi.

799
00:41:23,148 --> 00:41:24,524
- Hi.
- Is everything...

800
00:41:31,531 --> 00:41:32,532
I'm staying.

801
00:41:34,284 --> 00:41:35,367
You're not going to Chicago?

802
00:41:35,368 --> 00:41:36,786
I'm not going to Chicago.

803
00:41:43,793 --> 00:41:45,253
<i>Make everyone hear you.</i>

804
00:41:45,962 --> 00:41:47,171
<i>Because if you don't...</i>

805
00:41:47,172 --> 00:41:48,422
How did it go?

806
00:41:48,423 --> 00:41:49,674
Good. Good.

807
00:41:50,342 --> 00:41:51,343
Where the hell were you?

808
00:41:52,219 --> 00:41:53,594
- Did you talk to my mom?
- I did.

809
00:41:53,595 --> 00:41:54,887
- Uh-huh.
- Yeah.

810
00:41:54,888 --> 00:41:58,307
She said you will stop the injunctions
and the cease and desist letters.

811
00:41:58,308 --> 00:42:00,059
And everyone can have their jobs back.

812
00:42:00,060 --> 00:42:01,143
Oh, thank God.

813
00:42:01,144 --> 00:42:02,938
And you'll continue the research?

814
00:42:03,813 --> 00:42:04,814
Yes, I will.

815
00:42:05,315 --> 00:42:06,441
But not here.

816
00:42:07,192 --> 00:42:08,443
Not here?

817
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:10,736
But I thought you said
we could have our jobs.

818
00:42:10,737 --> 00:42:11,863
You can.

819
00:42:12,364 --> 00:42:14,366
You should take yours in Seattle.

820
00:42:16,701 --> 00:42:19,663
And, uh, the research will just go
in a different direction.

821
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:24,709
<i>...it will eat you up inside.</i>
