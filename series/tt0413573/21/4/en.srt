we place drapes over our patient,</i>

Incoming... [sighs]
...and I don't have a lot of time.

00:00:27,482 --> 00:00:29,776
Do you wanna use one of
our other three bathrooms to vomit?

8
00:00:29,860 --> 00:00:33,655
[shushes] I feel decent for the first time
in weeks, so don't jinx it.

9
00:00:33,739 --> 00:00:35,866
And don't forget we have
our first OB appointment today.

10
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:37,868
- I thought that was after work.
- It is.

11
00:00:37,951 --> 00:00:39,202
So what's the rush?

12
00:00:39,286 --> 00:00:42,039
Well, the kids are still asleep,
my charts are done,

13
00:00:42,122 --> 00:00:44,624
and I've got just enough time
for a quick shower.

14
00:00:47,586 --> 00:00:49,046
How quick?

15
00:00:49,588 --> 00:00:51,256
If it's too quick, I'll kill you.

a complication under the drape.</i>

18
00:01:00,891 --> 00:01:02,893
Oh, and we switched to a new EMR now.

19
00:01:02,976 --> 00:01:05,145
You select the medication on top

20
00:01:05,228 --> 00:01:07,355
and then scroll all the way down
to enter the dosage.

21
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:09,024
- Makes no sense.
- Medication up top.

22
00:01:09,107 --> 00:01:10,442
Dosage on the bottom. Got it.

23
00:01:10,525 --> 00:01:13,111
And you're only allowed
two pairs of scrubs now.

24
00:01:13,195 --> 00:01:15,947
- It's all automated...
- Miranda, I've been a resident before.

25
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:17,532
- I'll be okay.
- You're not nervous?

26
00:01:17,616 --> 00:01:19,659
I feel great. It's like coming home.

27
00:01:19,743 --> 00:01:21,244
Dr. Bailey, welcome back.

28
00:01:21,328 --> 00:01:23,330
Yeah, welcome back to the both of you.

29
00:01:23,413 --> 00:01:25,999
Oh, Warren, do you... do you know Dr. Ndugu?

30
00:01:26,083 --> 00:01:28,251
What, are you kidding?
Tore up the dance floor at his wedding.

31
00:01:28,335 --> 00:01:31,254
My moves were basically a meme.
I was like... [grunts]

32
00:01:31,338 --> 00:01:33,423
- [Miranda] How's Catherine?
- Feeling better every day.

33
00:01:33,507 --> 00:01:35,842
Especially now that we know
the biopsy results were negative.

34
00:01:35,926 --> 00:01:37,010
Thank God.

35
00:01:37,094 --> 00:01:38,303
She wants to throw a party.

36
00:01:38,387 --> 00:01:41,640
Caviar and champagne, and not the kind
you get from your regular grocery store.

37
00:01:41,723 --> 00:01:44,351
[chuckles] I'd expect no less.
Send her our best.

38
00:01:44,434 --> 00:01:45,852
- Will do.
- Okay. [chuckles]

39
00:01:45,936 --> 00:01:47,687
This means stop talking.

40
00:01:47,771 --> 00:01:48,772
What?

41
00:01:48,855 --> 00:01:50,982
[sighs] Ndugu and Pierce

45

I refuse to be late
on Bailey's first day back.

46
00:01:59,783 --> 00:02:01,618
Tell that to the guy
who took a 20-minute shower.

47
00:02:01,701 --> 00:02:03,703
- Says the guy who doesn't live there.
- Hey.

48
00:02:03,787 --> 00:02:06,957
[panting] There was a fistfight
on my bus. I thought I was gonna be late.

49
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:09,126
Hey. Where's your sister?

50
00:02:09,209 --> 00:02:11,002
- We wanna meet your mini-Mika.
- [Mika] Late.

51
00:02:11,086 --> 00:02:13,088

Sorry. [sighs]

57
00:02:25,809 --> 00:02:28,979
I left my phone on the plane, and the line
for the bathroom was really long,

58
00:02:29,062 --> 00:02:31,314
and then Dumbledore
missed the freeway exit.

59
00:02:32,149 --> 00:02:35,318
My ride-share driver looked just like him.
I couldn't unsee it. [chuckles]

60
00:02:35,402 --> 00:02:36,445
Not alike at all.

That's Lucas, aka Skywalker.

Don't be late for Bailey.
We'll see you later.

67
00:02:55,505 --> 00:02:56,506
Come here.

68
00:02:57,632 --> 00:02:58,633
It's gonna be okay.

Here's the overnight roster list.

You need to follow up on Ms. Borgman's CT,

75
00:03:13,982 --> 00:03:18,361
and there are two rule out appy consults
in the ER waiting for ultrasounds. [sighs]

00:03:18,445 --> 00:03:19,529
Good morning to you too.

77
00:03:19,613 --> 00:03:22,115
Not all of us
just spent two weeks in Paris.

78
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:23,950
Clearly. Mmm.

79

This is nothing like a cafÃ© crÃ¨me.

Will you just take this so I can go home
and face-plant into my pillow?

- Morning.
- Good morning.

I work when I'm needed.

88
00:03:45,597 --> 00:03:47,099
Is that from the coffee cart?

89
00:03:47,182 --> 00:03:48,892
[clicks tongue] Uh, no.
I drink French now.

90

It's Le Gateau Jolie down the street.

Ah, okay.

92
00:03:53,271 --> 00:03:55,065
[inhales] I could use some coffee.

93
00:03:55,649 --> 00:03:57,067

- [doctor] Welcome back, boy. [chuckles]
- [chuckles]

99
00:04:08,328 --> 00:04:11,581
So, Bailey's her husband's boss?
Is that allowed?

100
00:04:11,665 --> 00:04:13,250
One of your aunts is
head of the neuro department,

101
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:14,835
and your other aunt's name
is on the building.

102
00:04:14,918 --> 00:04:17,254
Heron hired him before she left.
Everyone says he's impressive.

103
00:04:17,337 --> 00:04:20,006
- Bring it. You all slow me down.
- Oh, my God. He's not your competition.

104
00:04:20,090 --> 00:04:23,343
He is a fourth-year on a trial basis
until the ACGME approves him to stay.

105
00:04:23,427 --> 00:04:26,930
Oh, there's a finite number of people
who can fit around an operating table.

106
00:04:27,013 --> 00:04:30,225
Everyone is my competition,
including Mr. Doctor Bailey.

107
00:04:30,308 --> 00:04:31,893
Uh, it's Warren, actually.

108
00:04:31,977 --> 00:04:33,103
Ben Warren.

109
00:04:33,729 --> 00:04:36,231
Looking forward to working with you again,
Dr. Kwan.

110
00:04:36,314 --> 00:04:37,649
I see you've met Dr. Warren.

111
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,276
Yes, he is my husband.

112
00:04:39,359 --> 00:04:41,361
No, he will not be getting
special treatment.

113
00:04:41,445 --> 00:04:45,991
As for the rest of you, any bad habits
you picked up while I was gone,

114
00:04:46,074 --> 00:04:47,075
lose them.

115
00:04:47,159 --> 00:04:49,828
You have four months left
in your intern year.

116
00:04:49,911 --> 00:04:53,457
I want you sprinting to that finish line,
understood?

117
00:04:53,957 --> 00:04:55,625
All right. Helm has your assignments.

118
00:04:55,709 --> 00:04:58,378
Any problem,
she'll be happy to hear about it.

119
00:04:59,504 --> 00:05:01,423
- Get to work.
- Okay.

120
00:05:01,506 --> 00:05:03,550
Griffith is with Ndugu.

121
00:05:03,633 --> 00:05:06,678
Warren and Kwan, to the pit.
Adams and Millin, with me.

122
00:05:08,055 --> 00:05:09,306

[groans] A hundred unread emails
after operating all night.

125
00:05:18,982 --> 00:05:20,734
Why do I like this job again?

126
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:22,319
- Were you in the OR?
- [scoffs] Yeah.

127
00:05:22,402 --> 00:05:25,113
Nasty bus accident at the airport.
I was called in around 4:00.

128
00:05:25,197 --> 00:05:26,698
- Kids are at my mom's.
- Oh, no.

129
00:05:26,782 --> 00:05:28,241
Why didn't you call me?

130
00:05:28,325 --> 00:05:30,827
I didn't wanna disturb you
while you were in surgery. What's wrong?

131
00:05:30,911 --> 00:05:32,746
I had muffins and bagels delivered
to the house

132
00:05:32,829 --> 00:05:34,664
because you've been
on the morning routine so often,

133
00:05:34,748 --> 00:05:36,416
and I wanted to take care of breakfast
for you.

134
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:38,794
- You should've said something.
- It was supposed to be a surprise.

135
00:05:38,877 --> 00:05:40,796
Do you think your mom
could go over there and grab them?

136
00:05:40,879 --> 00:05:42,214
I am in back-to-back meetings,

137
00:05:42,297 --> 00:05:45,175
and Richard wants the quarterly budget
report before it goes to the board.

138
00:05:45,258 --> 00:05:47,677
- Sounds like you need a break.
- That is the opposite of what I need.

139
00:05:47,761 --> 00:05:50,180
Trust me. I had your job.
You have to pace yourself.

140
00:05:50,806 --> 00:05:53,809
This job is very different
than the job you had ten years ago,

141
00:05:53,892 --> 00:05:56,061
but, um, thanks for the tip.

142
00:05:56,144 --> 00:05:57,854
I'm just trying to help.

143
00:05:58,355 --> 00:06:01,108

to learn human anatomy

149

of what it means to be human.

150
00:06:19,292 --> 00:06:20,961
- Are those...
- I hate this already.

Cadavers for Ander-Simmons's
med school anatomy lab.

152

We scan them so students have images
to help them diagnose

153
00:06:27,384 --> 00:06:30,387
how their cadavers died
during their anatomy class dissection.

154
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:31,722
Good luck.

155

[stammers] You're not helping?

156
00:06:33,473 --> 00:06:34,850
[speaking French]

157
00:06:36,727 --> 00:06:38,895
Pretty sure that means we're screwed.

158
00:06:40,063 --> 00:06:41,815
[both groan]

159
00:06:43,734 --> 00:06:45,986
- [announcer 2] <i>Dr. Koreskos to Peds.</i>
- [breathing heavily]

160
00:06:46,069 --> 00:06:47,738
<i>Dr. Vivian Koreskos to Peds.</i>

161
00:06:48,739 --> 00:06:49,740
Dr. Ndugu.

162
00:06:50,532 --> 00:06:52,284
Am I getting out of here today?

163
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:54,786
This pneumonia's taking up
all my field time.

164
00:06:55,454 --> 00:06:57,581
I'm supposed to be out
blocking a half-time show.

165
00:06:57,664 --> 00:07:00,000
[clicks tongue] Mr. Riley's
a high school band director.

166
00:07:00,083 --> 00:07:02,335
You win the state championship
three times in a row?

167
00:07:02,419 --> 00:07:05,589
Uh, come on. Don't take the fourth one
away from me. [chuckles]

168
00:07:05,672 --> 00:07:08,425
Well, we'll make this quick
so you can get back to it, all right?

169
00:07:08,508 --> 00:07:09,885
Dr. Griffith.

170
00:07:09,968 --> 00:07:13,430
Darren Riley, 55,
history of smoking and pulmonary fibrosis.

171
00:07:13,513 --> 00:07:16,349
Admitted for multi-drug-resistant
gram-negative pneumonia.

172
00:07:16,433 --> 00:07:18,602
Currently on 7 liters nasal cannula
and Vanc-Zosyn.

173
00:07:18,685 --> 00:07:20,562
Ah, there's music in the voice.

174
00:07:21,063 --> 00:07:23,565
- You sing?
- No, but I marched in high school.

175
00:07:23,648 --> 00:07:25,192
Birds of a feather.

176
00:07:25,776 --> 00:07:27,652
- Which instrument? [coughs]
- Trombone.

177
00:07:27,736 --> 00:07:30,280
[chuckles] Former bone player
and a doctor.

178
00:07:30,363 --> 00:07:31,490
That's not bad.

179
00:07:31,573 --> 00:07:32,824
- It's not.
- [Darren chuckles]

180
00:07:32,908 --> 00:07:35,452
- Sats are low despite the nasal cannula.
- Okay.

181
00:07:35,535 --> 00:07:38,205
Uh, let's put him on high flow
and then get him to CT.

182
00:07:38,288 --> 00:07:40,082
Dr. Griffith's gonna take you
for some scans.

183
00:07:40,165 --> 00:07:41,166
More scans?

184
00:07:41,249 --> 00:07:43,710
We're doing everything we can
to get out of here, okay?

185
00:07:45,170 --> 00:07:49,174
Stay close. No local family,
and his last ABG came back borderline.

186
00:07:52,511 --> 00:07:55,263
I reviewed your scans with radiology.

187
00:07:56,181 --> 00:07:59,434
There is some
suspicious-appearing lymph nodes.

188
00:07:59,518 --> 00:08:02,687
It's likely stage 3B rectal cancer
due to the...

189
00:08:02,771 --> 00:08:04,189
Wait, 3B?

190
00:08:04,272 --> 00:08:05,399
I thought it was 2A.

191
00:08:05,482 --> 00:08:07,317
Mimi, can you just stop moving?

192
00:08:08,193 --> 00:08:09,361
Sorry. [sighs]

193
00:08:09,444 --> 00:08:10,445
[Richard clears throat]

194
00:08:11,279 --> 00:08:13,281
Okay. Uh, what happens next? [sighs]

195
00:08:13,365 --> 00:08:14,616
Chemotherapy, radiation?

196
00:08:14,699 --> 00:08:15,700
Correct.

197
00:08:15,784 --> 00:08:18,453
Surgery's a possibility,
depending on the tumor's response.

198
00:08:18,537 --> 00:08:19,913
Will I lose my hair?

199
00:08:19,996 --> 00:08:21,081
It's possible.

200
00:08:21,915 --> 00:08:23,583
What other side effects are there?

201
00:08:23,667 --> 00:08:25,836
It varies from patient to patient.

202
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,172
Radiation often causes
impaired ovarian function.

203
00:08:29,256 --> 00:08:31,049
There is nausea and fatigue,

204
00:08:31,133 --> 00:08:33,635
and changes in mood
and weight are common too.

205
00:08:34,344 --> 00:08:36,096
I won't be able to have kids?

206
00:08:37,013 --> 00:08:40,517
We'll have you talk to an ob-gyn
about your options.

207
00:08:41,601 --> 00:08:43,603
Do you have any other questions
for me? [distorted]

208
00:08:44,271 --> 00:08:45,981
[Chloe] How long does chemo usually take?

209
00:08:46,064 --> 00:08:48,608
[Richard, distorted]

210
00:09:05,666 --> 00:09:10,629
{\an8}Wait. So, you went from Wyoming
to Raleigh to St. Louis to Seattle?

211
00:09:10,713 --> 00:09:12,339
{\an8}There were a bunch of places in between.

212
00:09:12,423 --> 00:09:14,925
{\an8}Uh, I did the whole global nomad thing
before divinity school.

213
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:16,343
{\an8}I've only ever lived here.

214
00:09:16,844 --> 00:09:18,763
{\an8}But you travel, right?

215
00:09:19,346 --> 00:09:22,016
{\an8}Well, I used to visit my grandparents
in Illinois.

216
00:09:23,017 --> 00:09:25,436
{\an8}Wait, but then how did you end up
becoming a chaplain?

217
00:09:25,519 --> 00:09:29,273
{\an8}I grew up in Wyoming
with two devout episcopal parents.

218
00:09:29,774 --> 00:09:32,902
{\an8}[stutters] I love them,
but it was, uh, complicated.

219
00:09:33,736 --> 00:09:36,489
{\an8}Was it like a...
like a hard coming out thing or...

220
00:09:36,572 --> 00:09:38,032
{\an8}No, not really. Um...

221
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,201
{\an8}Uh, I'm an only child,

222
00:09:40,785 --> 00:09:43,788
{\an8}and I always felt this pressure
to be their everything.

223
00:09:44,455 --> 00:09:45,456
{\an8}And, uh...

224
00:09:46,248 --> 00:09:47,875
{\an8}I don't know, I-I needed space.

225
00:09:47,958 --> 00:09:49,960
{\an8}So, left home, never looked back,

226
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:52,171
{\an8}and then they died.

227
00:09:54,006 --> 00:09:55,007
{\an8}I'm so sorry.

228
00:09:55,091 --> 00:09:58,594
{\an8}[stammers] I wish I had a more
noble reason for becoming a chaplain,

229
00:09:59,595 --> 00:10:04,100
{\an8}but truth is, I only really found
my faith again because of grief and guilt.

230
00:10:04,183 --> 00:10:07,186
{\an8}Sometimes you have to help yourself
in order to help others.

231
00:10:08,187 --> 00:10:09,438
{\an8}That's very poetic.

232
00:10:09,522 --> 00:10:11,065
{\an8}That's my mother. [chuckles]

233
00:10:11,732 --> 00:10:13,317
{\an8}She's a whole other conversation.
[chuckles]

234
00:10:14,735 --> 00:10:15,736
{\an8}I have time.

235
00:10:16,362 --> 00:10:17,446
{\an8}Wanna get lunch?

236
00:10:19,407 --> 00:10:20,408
{\an8}Yeah.

237
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,370
{\an8}[ER doctor] All right. Roll him up to CT.
Daniel will be there in two minutes.

238
00:10:24,453 --> 00:10:26,455
{\an8}[ER doctor 2]
They told us to come in at trauma 1.

239
00:10:27,707 --> 00:10:30,376
{\an8}Warren, nice to see you back this side
of the ambulance bay.

240
00:10:30,459 --> 00:10:32,795
{\an8}- You back full time?
- On a trial basis for now.

241
00:10:32,878 --> 00:10:35,172
{\an8}But don't go easy.
I'm just another resident.

242
00:10:35,256 --> 00:10:37,258
{\an8}Well, why don't you warm up
with some sutures?

243
00:10:37,341 --> 00:10:40,761
{\an8}We have a small thigh lac in bed three.
I just gave her some lido.

244
00:10:40,845 --> 00:10:43,139
{\an8}And, Kwan, you can help him out.

245
00:10:44,932 --> 00:10:45,933
{\an8}After you.

246
00:10:47,768 --> 00:10:49,979
{\an8}Uh... Ms. Dunn.

247
00:10:50,062 --> 00:10:52,314
{\an8}I'm Dr. Warren, and this is Dr. Kwan.

248
00:10:52,398 --> 00:10:53,399
{\an8}Judith is fine.

249
00:10:53,482 --> 00:10:54,483
{\an8}Not Judy.

250
00:10:54,567 --> 00:10:56,569
{\an8}Judy is my mother,
and she talks to her plants.

251
00:10:56,652 --> 00:10:57,945
{\an8}- Judith it is.
- [Judith chuckles]

252
00:10:58,028 --> 00:11:00,489
{\an8}It says here you have a cut on your thigh.
All right, let's take a look.

253
00:11:00,573 --> 00:11:02,116
{\an8}- Roll over, please.
- [grunts] Okay.

254
00:11:03,367 --> 00:11:04,201
{\an8}[Judith grunts]

255
00:11:06,328 --> 00:11:07,329
{\an8}[Judith sighs]

256
00:11:08,831 --> 00:11:09,915
{\an8}[Ben sighs]

257
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,587
{\an8}It was my own dumb fault.
Six-inch stilettos and tequila don't mix.

258
00:11:16,756 --> 00:11:18,340
{\an8}Oh, what was the occasion?

259
00:11:18,424 --> 00:11:20,676
{\an8}The tequila was for my friend's birthday.

260
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:22,303
{\an8}Heels were for my new peach.

261
00:11:22,386 --> 00:11:24,597
{\an8}[chuckles] I got a BBL two months ago.

262
00:11:26,098 --> 00:11:27,349
{\an8}A Brazilian butt lift.

263
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:29,435
{\an8}Oh. [chuckles] We're familiar.

264
00:11:31,771 --> 00:11:34,940
{\an8}Careful, Doctor. All that drool
could stain your white coat. [chuckles]

265
00:11:35,024 --> 00:11:36,984
{\an8}No. No, no. It's, uh...
It's not what you think.

266
00:11:37,068 --> 00:11:38,027
{\an8}Um...

267
00:11:38,110 --> 00:11:39,612
{\an8}I grabbed the wrong sutures.

268
00:11:39,695 --> 00:11:42,031
{\an8}Can you grab me a 4-0 Monocryl?

269
00:11:42,114 --> 00:11:43,115
{\an8}Thank you.

270
00:11:43,949 --> 00:11:45,910
{\an8}I-I was just getting a better suture
for your cut.

271
00:11:45,993 --> 00:11:47,661
{\an8}How are you feeling?
You need more lidocaine?

272
00:11:47,745 --> 00:11:51,499
{\an8}I don't feel the cut anymore, but...
[grunts] ...it's my hip that's killing me.

273
00:11:51,582 --> 00:11:52,583
{\an8}From the fall?

274
00:11:52,666 --> 00:11:54,877
{\an8}I finally feel well enough to take
this booty out for a spin,

275
00:11:54,960 --> 00:11:56,504
{\an8}and now my hip's hurting like hell.

276
00:11:56,587 --> 00:12:00,091
{\an8}It's probably just bruising, but we'll
get some labs and X-rays just to be safe.

277
00:12:00,174 --> 00:12:02,426
{\an8}Uh, can you grab the labs
and I'll take care of the X-rays?

278
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:03,761
{\an8}You got it, boss.

279
00:12:06,347 --> 00:12:08,641
{\an8}[sighs, grunts]

280
00:12:09,558 --> 00:12:11,060
{\an8}[both grunt]

281
00:12:11,143 --> 00:12:13,854
{\an8}Oh, why is it that everybody
who donates their body to science

282
00:12:13,938 --> 00:12:15,231
{\an8}- weighs 800 pounds?
- They don't.

283
00:12:15,314 --> 00:12:17,566
{\an8}They just can't change
their center of gravity like live people.

284
00:12:17,650 --> 00:12:18,984
{\an8}- They're literally dead weight.
- Okay.

285
00:12:19,068 --> 00:12:20,528
{\an8}- Can you hold your side up more?
- I am.

286
00:12:20,611 --> 00:12:22,613
{\an8}- He's sagging.
- I don't think he cares.

287
00:12:22,696 --> 00:12:24,115
{\an8}[both grunt]

288
00:12:25,241 --> 00:12:26,075
{\an8}[huffs]

289
00:12:26,158 --> 00:12:29,286
{\an8}Well, the good news is, uh,
we only have 29 left of these. [panting]

290
00:12:29,370 --> 00:12:30,663
{\an8}What's the bad news?

291
00:12:33,749 --> 00:12:36,252
{\an8}- [sighs] He's on feet first.
- [groans] No.

292
00:12:38,087 --> 00:12:39,004
{\an8}[sighs]

293
00:12:46,721 --> 00:12:47,722
{\an8}[clicks tongue]

294
00:12:48,431 --> 00:12:52,143
{\an8}[clears throat] Uh, Griffith,
how busy are you?

295
00:12:52,226 --> 00:12:54,228
{\an8}I'm almost done inputting orders
for Dr. Ndugu,

296
00:12:54,311 --> 00:12:57,106
{\an8}and then I should start rounds
in about 20 minutes.

297
00:12:57,189 --> 00:13:00,443
{\an8}- Oh, just enough time to run to the pit.
- You need something there?

298
00:13:00,526 --> 00:13:04,113
{\an8}There are a couple of patients
on Dr. Hunt's service.

299
00:13:04,196 --> 00:13:05,489
{\an8}Can you check on them for me?

300
00:13:05,573 --> 00:13:07,491
{\an8}You need me to add someone
to my roster list?

301
00:13:07,575 --> 00:13:08,617
{\an8}Oh, no, no.

302
00:13:08,701 --> 00:13:10,953
{\an8}Uh, just see how things are going.

303
00:13:11,746 --> 00:13:14,540
{\an8}Like, check and see if the patients
are satisfied with their care here?

304
00:13:14,623 --> 00:13:17,835
{\an8}[stammers] Um, you don't need
to say anything to them.

305
00:13:17,918 --> 00:13:21,005
{\an8}Just discreetly observe.

306
00:13:21,672 --> 00:13:24,175
{\an8}See how the patients are doing.

307
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:28,179
{\an8}See how the doctors are doing.

308
00:13:29,346 --> 00:13:32,933
{\an8}Got it. And then I should circle back
with you after?

309
00:13:33,809 --> 00:13:35,561
{\an8}Took the words right out of my mouth.

310
00:13:36,228 --> 00:13:37,354
{\an8}[chuckles]

311
00:13:39,231 --> 00:13:42,068
{\an8}We typically recommend
hormone replacement therapy

312
00:13:42,151 --> 00:13:45,821
{\an8}for the loss of estrogen production
and fertility.

313
00:13:45,905 --> 00:13:48,574
{\an8}So that would allow me
to have kids later if I want?

314
00:13:48,657 --> 00:13:49,950
{\an8}Well, there's no guarantees.

315
00:13:50,034 --> 00:13:52,286
{\an8}But if you wanna increase your chances,

316
00:13:52,369 --> 00:13:54,914
{\an8}many patients opt to retrieve
and freeze their eggs.

317
00:13:54,997 --> 00:13:56,123
{\an8}What do you think?

318
00:13:56,957 --> 00:14:00,378
{\an8}Uh, it'll take at least a month
to do a round of egg retrieval.

319
00:14:00,461 --> 00:14:02,880
{\an8}That's if your body responds to
the hormones correctly.

320
00:14:02,963 --> 00:14:05,633
{\an8}The cancer could spread to a later stage
during that time.

321
00:14:06,592 --> 00:14:08,094
{\an8}There are other options, right?

322
00:14:08,177 --> 00:14:11,889
{\an8}At this time, egg freezing
is the most effective and common.

323
00:14:11,972 --> 00:14:13,766
{\an8}Okay. Well, find something else.

324
00:14:13,849 --> 00:14:16,519
{\an8}Look at other colorectal cancer cases,
meet with your department.

325
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:18,437
{\an8}- Yasuda...
- There has to be a way.

326
00:14:18,521 --> 00:14:20,189
{\an8}It's okay, Mimi.

327
00:14:20,272 --> 00:14:22,108
{\an8}I'm not sure I really want kids anyway.

328
00:14:25,236 --> 00:14:26,237
{\an8}Warren.

329
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,571
{\an8}Nice to see you back.

330
00:14:28,406 --> 00:14:29,490
{\an8}What do we got?

331
00:14:29,573 --> 00:14:32,076
{\an8}Thirty-four-year-old female,
history of type 2 diabetes,

332
00:14:32,159 --> 00:14:34,161
{\an8}tripped and fell onto her
left thigh three days ago.

333
00:14:34,245 --> 00:14:35,746
Sustained a thigh laceration

334
00:14:35,830 --> 00:14:38,916
but has pain with weight bearing
that's getting more severe.

335
00:14:38,999 --> 00:14:40,835
- How are her labs?
- Still waiting.

336
00:14:40,918 --> 00:14:42,795
- I just called to put a rush on it.
- Hmm.

337
00:14:42,878 --> 00:14:44,714
You think it's a hip joint effusion?

338
00:14:44,797 --> 00:14:47,550
[Atticus] I couldn't tell you.
This is a lateral hip. I need an AP view.

339
00:14:47,633 --> 00:14:50,970
[stutters] I don't know what happened.
I ordered an X-ray series.

340
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:52,722
The system is a little funky.

341
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:55,141
You gotta go to the drop-down
to order the AP view.

342
00:14:55,224 --> 00:14:58,102
Hip joint effusions
are difficult to see on X-rays.

343
00:14:58,185 --> 00:15:00,187
- A CT scan would give better visibility.
- [stammers]

344
00:15:00,271 --> 00:15:01,397
Kwan's right.

345
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,607
- Page us when you've got it.
- [clears throat] Mmm.

346
00:15:03,691 --> 00:15:06,944
- You want me to show you how to...
- No. [stutters] I got it. I got it.

347
00:15:08,779 --> 00:15:10,531
[sniffs, sighs]

348
00:15:11,782 --> 00:15:13,242
- Oh. Ah.
- Whoa.

349
00:15:13,868 --> 00:15:14,744
Oh.

350
00:15:14,827 --> 00:15:15,828
[sighs]

351
00:15:17,288 --> 00:15:18,289
Are you okay?

352
00:15:19,123 --> 00:15:21,459
Chloe's cancer is more advanced
than we thought.

353
00:15:21,542 --> 00:15:22,543
I'm so sorry.

354
00:15:22,626 --> 00:15:24,712
Webber asked Dr. Sugihara
to see her. [sighs]

355
00:15:24,795 --> 00:15:27,298
- Chief of oncology. That's good.
- It's terrible.

356
00:15:27,381 --> 00:15:29,050
She has to start chemo
and radiation right away,

357
00:15:29,133 --> 00:15:31,719
which means she doesn't have time
to protect her fertility.

358
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:34,764
Oh. I mean, does she want kids?

359
00:15:34,847 --> 00:15:36,348
She's 22.

360
00:15:36,932 --> 00:15:38,934
She doesn't know
what she wants for breakfast tomorrow.

361
00:15:39,810 --> 00:15:42,521
She's the eighth out of eight sisters.

362
00:15:43,022 --> 00:15:46,859
She spent her whole life getting dragged
to our practices, our recitals.

363
00:15:46,942 --> 00:15:49,070
She only ever had hand-me-downs.

364
00:15:49,153 --> 00:15:52,156
Always had to watch us on the roller
coasters because she wasn't tall enough.

365
00:15:52,948 --> 00:15:56,619
And now that she's finally out of our
shadows and starting to live her own life,

366
00:15:57,578 --> 00:15:58,579
this.

367
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:04,460
Her future should be wide open,
not limited by an awful disease.

368
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:06,253
Well, at least she'll still be alive.

369
00:16:07,463 --> 00:16:09,298
- What is that supposed to mean?
- Nothing.

370
00:16:09,382 --> 00:16:11,926
I'm just trying to look
on the bright side.

371
00:16:12,009 --> 00:16:14,762
My sister has cancer.
There is no bright side.

372
00:16:14,845 --> 00:16:17,598
But you wouldn't get that, would you?
Because you don't have sisters.

373
00:16:17,681 --> 00:16:20,267
You have one brother
who thinks celery juice changes lives,

374
00:16:20,351 --> 00:16:21,602
and you don't even like him.

375
00:16:21,685 --> 00:16:24,146
So please don't pretend to understand
what this feels like.

376
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:25,398
You never will.

377
00:16:32,571 --> 00:16:34,073
[sighs]

378
00:16:39,078 --> 00:16:41,747
No. No way.
You're living in complete fantasy.

379
00:16:41,831 --> 00:16:44,583
- You asked my opinion.
- Well, I wasn't expecting it to be wrong.

380
00:16:45,209 --> 00:16:47,586
I am a man of science.
I don't know what else to tell you.

381
00:16:47,670 --> 00:16:50,005
The <i>Millennium Falcon</i>
can go faster than light.

382
00:16:50,089 --> 00:16:51,215
It has hyperdrive.

383
00:16:51,298 --> 00:16:54,009
That thing breaks down more often
than my mom's old Ford Taurus.

384
00:16:54,093 --> 00:16:56,095
It made the Kessel Run
in under 12 parsecs.

385
00:16:56,178 --> 00:17:00,099
The Kessel Run tests navigation,
not speed.

386
00:17:00,182 --> 00:17:01,892
The <i>Enterprise</i> is exponentially faster.

387
00:17:01,976 --> 00:17:04,395
- How do you figure?
- Warp 1 is the speed of light.

388
00:17:04,478 --> 00:17:07,732
Even the original <i>Enterprise</i>
went up to warp 5. Who are you?

389
00:17:07,815 --> 00:17:11,527
So you would rather be the captain
of the <i>Enterprise</i> than Han Solo?

390
00:17:11,610 --> 00:17:13,738
- Obviously.
- Do you wanna go back to my place?

391
00:17:13,821 --> 00:17:15,322
Obviously.

392
00:17:17,950 --> 00:17:18,993
[chuckle]

393
00:17:28,085 --> 00:17:29,128
[grunts]

394
00:17:29,628 --> 00:17:30,796
[panting]

395
00:17:32,423 --> 00:17:33,758
[both chuckling]

396
00:17:41,098 --> 00:17:42,767
- Hey, hey, hey, hey.
- [chuckles]

397
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:44,852
- I thought you were on cardio today.
- [chuckles] What? I am.

398
00:17:44,935 --> 00:17:46,979
I had to run downstairs for something.

399
00:17:47,063 --> 00:17:50,733
- Well, I'm, uh, glad I got to see you.
- [sighs]

400
00:17:51,233 --> 00:17:52,485
Mmm.

401
00:17:52,568 --> 00:17:53,569
[door opens]

402
00:17:56,155 --> 00:17:57,156
Hi.

403
00:17:59,950 --> 00:18:02,119
- [chuckles]
- [door opens, closes]

404
00:18:02,203 --> 00:18:04,038
[smacks lips] Can I ask you
a hypothetical question?

405
00:18:04,121 --> 00:18:05,039
Yeah.

406
00:18:05,122 --> 00:18:07,792
If you were asked to review
a colleague's performance,

407
00:18:07,875 --> 00:18:11,337
and they made an inconsequential mistake,
would you mention it?

408
00:18:11,420 --> 00:18:13,089
[smacks lips]
Are we getting peer reviewed?

409
00:18:13,672 --> 00:18:16,467
No. More of, uh, an informal observation.

410
00:18:16,550 --> 00:18:17,885
Will they get in trouble?

411
00:18:17,968 --> 00:18:19,804
- I don't think so.
- Okay.

412
00:18:19,887 --> 00:18:24,600
So, uh, then nothing major went wrong
and there are no consequences?

413
00:18:24,683 --> 00:18:26,769
Think you answered my question.

414
00:18:29,522 --> 00:18:30,856
How's your project with Helm?

415
00:18:30,940 --> 00:18:32,566
Is it something fun?

416
00:18:32,650 --> 00:18:34,110
Deathly boring?

417
00:18:34,193 --> 00:18:35,903
Definitely the latter.

418
00:18:35,986 --> 00:18:37,113
Hmm.

419
00:18:43,828 --> 00:18:47,498
Your sister went outside to get some air
and call your parents.

420
00:18:48,624 --> 00:18:49,625
Oh.

421
00:18:50,626 --> 00:18:53,504
Colorectal cancer and fertility studies?

422
00:18:53,587 --> 00:18:55,172
Just educating myself.

423
00:18:55,256 --> 00:18:57,383
I know you want things
to be better for Chloe.

424
00:18:57,466 --> 00:18:58,467
She's my sister.

425
00:18:58,551 --> 00:19:00,386
And you're also a surgeon.

426
00:19:01,011 --> 00:19:03,597
We like to believe
we can solve everyone's problems.

427
00:19:04,265 --> 00:19:07,977
I really thought there'd be other options,
but... [sighs] ...Wilson's right.

428
00:19:08,060 --> 00:19:09,061
You know,

429
00:19:10,479 --> 00:19:15,317
I've seen a lot of cancer patients
in my career.

430
00:19:16,235 --> 00:19:22,324
And no matter the type or stage,
the treatment process... it's grueling.

431
00:19:22,408 --> 00:19:27,038
Some people say the side effects of it
are just as horrible as the cancer itself.

432
00:19:27,121 --> 00:19:31,542
Everyone has the same questions,
and they reckon with the same concerns.

433
00:19:31,625 --> 00:19:34,003
Cancer is universal that way.

434
00:19:34,879 --> 00:19:35,963
It's universal.

435
00:19:36,047 --> 00:19:38,716
What if I can find a precedent
for protecting fertility

436
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:40,134
when treating other cancers?

437
00:19:41,385 --> 00:19:44,889
Then I'd be willing to bet
it's relevant to colorectal cancer too.

438
00:19:51,479 --> 00:19:52,897
Oh, Jo. Jo.

439
00:19:52,980 --> 00:19:55,566
[gasps] Ben Warren. Oh, my God.

440
00:19:55,649 --> 00:19:57,443
You missed me, I missed you.
It's great to be back.

441
00:19:57,526 --> 00:20:00,488
I just gave someone a heparin drip
instead of prophylaxis.

442
00:20:00,571 --> 00:20:01,655
How do I stop it?

443
00:20:01,739 --> 00:20:06,077
Oh. Yeah, the new EMR system is confusing.
Okay. Type in the patient's MRN there.

444
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:09,997
- And then you are gonna click here, here.
- Okay.

445
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,541
- You're done.
- Okay. [sighs, chuckles]

446
00:20:13,459 --> 00:20:16,295
I've had three careers. You'd think I'd
remember the first day is always rough.

447
00:20:16,379 --> 00:20:17,630
It'll get better.

448
00:20:17,713 --> 00:20:20,216
Kwan is lapping me,
and he's only been a doctor eight months.

449
00:20:20,299 --> 00:20:22,843
You'll be fine.
You've been off fighting fires.

450
00:20:23,427 --> 00:20:26,430
I went from splicing intestines
to delivering babies,

451
00:20:26,514 --> 00:20:30,142
and I still have no idea what day it is,
and I'm a constant mess.

452
00:20:30,226 --> 00:20:32,019
Yeah? What's new in your life?

453
00:20:32,520 --> 00:20:33,521
Can you keep a secret?

454
00:20:34,605 --> 00:20:35,898
- Yeah.
- [mutters]

455
00:20:35,981 --> 00:20:37,400
Yasuda, are you okay?

456
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:38,859
I need your help.

457
00:20:40,111 --> 00:20:41,112
Okay.

458
00:20:43,030 --> 00:20:44,365
Hey. [sighs]

459
00:20:44,448 --> 00:20:46,117
Turkey burgers from the cafeteria.

460
00:20:47,159 --> 00:20:49,412
Listen... [smacks lips]
...I think earlier I might've...

461
00:20:49,495 --> 00:20:52,206
Insinuated that you know the job
better than me?

462
00:20:52,289 --> 00:20:53,999
- You're lucky I'm hungry.
- [chuckles]

463
00:20:54,083 --> 00:20:55,751
[sighs] Hey,
would you ever get a butt lift?

464
00:20:55,835 --> 00:20:58,504
Uh, no, no, no.
No, no. I'm not suggesting...

465
00:20:58,587 --> 00:21:00,339
You are... You are perfect.

466
00:21:00,423 --> 00:21:02,258
But there's a woman in the ER.

467
00:21:02,341 --> 00:21:05,302
She just had one, and, uh, I don't get it.

468
00:21:05,386 --> 00:21:08,139
- What don't you get?
- Well, it's a surgery with risks. And why?

469
00:21:08,222 --> 00:21:09,890
So you can wear different clothes?
[chuckles]

470
00:21:09,974 --> 00:21:12,977
Wait, you think that this woman
underwent anesthesia,

471
00:21:13,060 --> 00:21:15,020
had surgeons cut into her glute,

472
00:21:15,104 --> 00:21:17,356
suck fat from her belly
and put it back in her butt

473
00:21:17,440 --> 00:21:19,734
just so that she could wear
different clothes?

474
00:21:20,735 --> 00:21:22,403
I mean, why else would she do it?

475
00:21:23,237 --> 00:21:24,989
Let me break it down for you.

476
00:21:25,072 --> 00:21:27,450
The world that you live in
where you do a good job

477
00:21:27,533 --> 00:21:30,286
and you get rewarded for it,
that is not the world that women live in.

478
00:21:30,369 --> 00:21:34,331
In our world, you can be smarter,
you can work harder,

479
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:38,085
but the prettier person
who has a more desirable body

480
00:21:38,169 --> 00:21:39,670
almost always gets ahead

481
00:21:39,754 --> 00:21:43,174
because the people who decide that
are almost always men.

482
00:21:43,257 --> 00:21:45,926
So before we rush to judge the woman

483
00:21:46,010 --> 00:21:49,597
for being so desperate that she underwent
surgery to change her body,

484
00:21:49,680 --> 00:21:53,350
maybe we should think about how
our culture prioritizes the wrong things

485
00:21:53,434 --> 00:21:55,478
and think about how we can change that.

486
00:21:55,561 --> 00:21:56,937
I was just asking.

487
00:21:57,021 --> 00:21:59,148
- And I was just answering.
- [phone buzzing]

488
00:21:59,774 --> 00:22:02,443
Sorry, I have to take this.
Um, thank you for the burger.

489
00:22:02,526 --> 00:22:04,987
Yeah, no. I wanna review that.

490
00:22:05,071 --> 00:22:08,282
[grunts] Never thought I'd say this,
but I am missing Pearl.

491
00:22:08,365 --> 00:22:10,117
Is that your partner or your friend?

492
00:22:10,201 --> 00:22:11,702
My booty pillow. [sighs]

493
00:22:11,786 --> 00:22:13,871
These cheeks could use
a good cushion. [chuckles]

494
00:22:13,954 --> 00:22:16,207
- Are you in more pain?
- A little. [sighs]

495
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:18,376
Well, the scans will be quick,
so just try to sit still.

496
00:22:18,459 --> 00:22:19,627
[titters]

497
00:22:19,710 --> 00:22:21,212
[Judith] I know what you're thinking.

498
00:22:21,295 --> 00:22:24,507
Trust me, my family gave me grief
for getting surgery too.

499
00:22:25,132 --> 00:22:27,885
But for 30 years,
no one blinked an eye at me.

500
00:22:27,968 --> 00:22:30,304
I was the sidekick with the pancake butt.

501
00:22:30,388 --> 00:22:33,724
[chuckles] But then, overnight,
I became the star.

502
00:22:35,059 --> 00:22:37,561
I've never felt more empowered
in my own skin.

503
00:22:38,562 --> 00:22:41,315
Forget the jobs that work from home
and the movies on the couch.

504
00:22:41,816 --> 00:22:44,610
I'm planning on taking this beauty
all across town.

505
00:22:46,153 --> 00:22:47,154
The labs are in.

506
00:22:48,072 --> 00:22:49,907
White count is 18,000.

507
00:22:50,741 --> 00:22:53,077
That can't be right. Are you sure
you're looking at the right value?

508
00:22:53,160 --> 00:22:55,204
Yeah. I'm more than familiar
with our lab result system.

509
00:22:55,287 --> 00:22:57,790
If you wanna rerun them,
I'll let Dr. Hunt know.

510
00:22:57,873 --> 00:22:59,542
These numbers are off the charts.

511
00:23:00,292 --> 00:23:01,293
Oh, scans are up.

512
00:23:03,254 --> 00:23:04,255
You see that?

513
00:23:04,338 --> 00:23:07,383
Extensive signs of infection
to the muscles along the fascial planes.

514
00:23:08,217 --> 00:23:10,094
- [Judith] Are we done?
- [sigh]

515
00:23:10,177 --> 00:23:12,179
Judith, I'm gonna have to
check your hip again.

516
00:23:12,263 --> 00:23:13,264
- May I?
- Yeah.

517
00:23:15,349 --> 00:23:17,351
- Is that...
- Necrotizing fasciitis.

518
00:23:18,769 --> 00:23:21,564
- Someone help me with this gurney.
- What's going on? What's happening?

519
00:23:21,647 --> 00:23:24,316
You have a fast-moving soft tissue
infection, but don't worry, we're faster.

520
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:26,777
[stammers] Page the attendings
and book an OR right now.

521
00:23:26,861 --> 00:23:29,488
On my count. One, two, three.

522
00:23:34,160 --> 00:23:35,327
[Levi breathes deeply]

523
00:23:36,287 --> 00:23:38,289
I like that painting. [sighs]

524
00:23:38,372 --> 00:23:40,958
You get to wake up to the sunrise
even when it's raining.

525
00:23:43,127 --> 00:23:46,130
I thought you were gonna say
"even in the middle of the day."

526
00:23:47,715 --> 00:23:50,051
- [moans] That too.
- Mm-hmm.

527
00:23:50,134 --> 00:23:51,135
[grunts]

528
00:23:52,470 --> 00:23:53,471
I, um...

529
00:23:54,305 --> 00:23:56,307
I got it at an Italian restaurant.

530
00:23:56,390 --> 00:23:57,850
Is it Nicoletti's?

531
00:23:59,810 --> 00:24:02,313
No, it was a little cafÃ©
in Cortona, Italy.

532
00:24:04,482 --> 00:24:07,735
I was going through a rough time,
so I booked a red-eye to Florence.

533
00:24:08,486 --> 00:24:12,990
And I told myself I would visit every
art museum between there and Vatican City.

534
00:24:14,241 --> 00:24:15,576
I...

535
00:24:15,659 --> 00:24:19,663
I strained my neck gazing at
Michelangelo's work in the Sistine Chapel.

536
00:24:19,747 --> 00:24:21,415
- And, uh...
- [chuckles]

537
00:24:22,333 --> 00:24:26,170
I don't know. When I saw that sunrise,
it lifted something up in me.

538
00:24:28,255 --> 00:24:33,260
So, I asked the restaurant owner
if he would sell it to me.

539
00:24:34,261 --> 00:24:38,849
You know how sometimes
you just feel a strong connection?

540
00:24:40,267 --> 00:24:41,268
I do.

541
00:24:56,617 --> 00:24:59,870
Page me as soon as his ABG gets back.
Dr. Ndugu's asking.

542
00:25:03,290 --> 00:25:04,291
Dr. Griffith?

543
00:25:06,293 --> 00:25:07,545
[clears throat]

544
00:25:07,628 --> 00:25:11,215
So how was everything
with the patient in the ER?

545
00:25:11,298 --> 00:25:12,800
Things seem smooth?

546
00:25:12,883 --> 00:25:14,385
Everything appeared in control.

547
00:25:14,468 --> 00:25:17,555
I don't think you have anything
to worry about on the case.

548
00:25:17,638 --> 00:25:18,806
Mm-hmm.

549
00:25:18,889 --> 00:25:21,100
Oh, you think or you know?

550
00:25:21,183 --> 00:25:24,186
Are we talking about big booty Judy or...
Right.

551
00:25:25,980 --> 00:25:26,814
[stammers, sighs]

552
00:25:26,897 --> 00:25:31,694
Look, um, it's not that I don't think
he will succeed.

553
00:25:31,777 --> 00:25:36,741
Um, I also wanna make sure
that he has an objective experience.

554
00:25:36,824 --> 00:25:38,826
The same treatment as everyone.

555
00:25:39,744 --> 00:25:42,496
And if I go down there,

556
00:25:42,580 --> 00:25:46,709
my appearance in the room
takes away that objectivity.

557
00:25:48,044 --> 00:25:49,962
I can spare another five minutes.

558
00:25:50,046 --> 00:25:51,047
Thank you.

559
00:25:54,383 --> 00:25:56,886
So you'd move my ovaries into my abdomen?

560
00:25:56,969 --> 00:25:59,805
We'd move them up
and attach them to the abdominal wall

561
00:25:59,889 --> 00:26:01,682
so they're out of the field of radiation.

562
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:03,768
Has this been done before?

563
00:26:04,685 --> 00:26:06,062
Ovarian transposition

564
00:26:06,145 --> 00:26:10,274
is often used to help preserve
the fertility of cervical cancer patients,

565
00:26:10,357 --> 00:26:13,277
but there's no reason
it couldn't apply to your case.

566
00:26:13,944 --> 00:26:15,446
I'll be able to have kids later?

567
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:18,365
There is a 50% to 80% success rate.

568
00:26:19,408 --> 00:26:20,743
That's better than zero.

569
00:26:20,826 --> 00:26:22,953
And if we can preserve
your ovarian function,

570
00:26:23,037 --> 00:26:25,456
then you likely will not need
hormone replacements.

571
00:26:25,539 --> 00:26:26,707
[gasps]

572
00:26:26,791 --> 00:26:28,042
This is great.

573
00:26:28,125 --> 00:26:29,293
Thank you so much.

574
00:26:29,377 --> 00:26:31,587
Thank your sister.
She's the one who thought of it.

575
00:26:31,670 --> 00:26:33,047
Can we do this today?

576
00:26:33,130 --> 00:26:35,049
That way, I can start treatment sooner,

577
00:26:35,132 --> 00:26:37,259
finish my last semester
before my scholarship runs out.

578
00:26:37,343 --> 00:26:40,096
I should totally do this right now, right?
I mean, just get it done?

579
00:26:40,179 --> 00:26:42,765
Okay. I'm gonna call Mom and Dad first,
but yes.

580
00:26:42,848 --> 00:26:45,643
You want Dr. Webber
and Dr. Wilson to be the ones to do it.

581
00:26:45,726 --> 00:26:47,645
And you can be in the operating room
with me.

582
00:26:48,479 --> 00:26:50,231
I can't, Chloe.

583
00:26:50,314 --> 00:26:51,315
Family's not allowed.

584
00:26:52,024 --> 00:26:54,068
Oh, right.

585
00:26:54,151 --> 00:26:55,361
Hey.

586
00:26:55,945 --> 00:26:58,072
Think of it like
one of your cross country races.

587
00:26:58,155 --> 00:27:01,659
It'll be over before you know it,
and I will be as close as I can be, okay?

588
00:27:01,742 --> 00:27:02,743
[softly] Okay.

589
00:27:02,827 --> 00:27:04,620
- Okay?
- Okay.

590
00:27:05,579 --> 00:27:06,580
Let's do it.

591
00:27:08,290 --> 00:27:10,292
[crunching]

592
00:27:12,545 --> 00:27:15,297
Do you always eat
when you're scanning patients?

593
00:27:15,381 --> 00:27:17,341
Well, I mean, technically,
he's not a patient.

594
00:27:17,925 --> 00:27:19,176
And he's in a bag.

595
00:27:19,927 --> 00:27:20,928
And dead.

596
00:27:22,096 --> 00:27:23,389
[phone buzzes]

597
00:27:24,974 --> 00:27:27,727
Uh, Yasuda's sister is getting surgery.

598
00:27:27,810 --> 00:27:28,894
Is it an emergency?

599
00:27:28,978 --> 00:27:30,312
[sighs] Doesn't seem like it.

600
00:27:30,396 --> 00:27:32,148
They're waiting for an OR to open.

601
00:27:33,983 --> 00:27:35,735
What's going on between you two?

602
00:27:35,818 --> 00:27:37,486
- [sighs] Nothing.
- [phone buzzes]

603
00:27:37,570 --> 00:27:38,571
Oh.

604
00:27:39,196 --> 00:27:40,322
Is that her?

605
00:27:40,406 --> 00:27:41,574
No, it's Maxine.

606
00:27:41,657 --> 00:27:43,200
Spaghetti and meatballs for dinner.

607
00:27:43,284 --> 00:27:45,035
Yasuda is not texting me.

608
00:27:46,036 --> 00:27:48,831
She basically accused me
of having no empathy.

609
00:27:48,914 --> 00:27:52,126
Well, her sister has cancer.
She's just stressed.

610
00:27:52,209 --> 00:27:54,170
You know what's not going to
make her sister get better?

611
00:27:54,253 --> 00:27:55,254
Being mean to me.

612
00:27:56,338 --> 00:27:57,339
Really?

613
00:27:58,132 --> 00:27:59,550
He can't hear me.

614
00:28:03,554 --> 00:28:05,681
Heart rate's in the 140s,
systolic's around 100.

615
00:28:05,765 --> 00:28:08,184
We broadened IV antibiotics
and started low-dose norepi.

616
00:28:08,267 --> 00:28:09,643
Judith, we're taking you up to the OR

617
00:28:09,727 --> 00:28:11,854
to remove the infected tissue
and stop it spreading, okay?

618
00:28:11,937 --> 00:28:13,147
[sobbing] Are you gonna take my butt?

619
00:28:13,230 --> 00:28:14,690
The infection seems to have spread
to your glute,

620
00:28:14,774 --> 00:28:17,443
- but we won't know till we get to the OR.
- No, I want a second opinion.

621
00:28:17,526 --> 00:28:20,029
There's no time for another opinion.
You have to trust us.

622
00:28:20,112 --> 00:28:22,156
I don't understand.
I just fell on the sidewalk.

623
00:28:22,239 --> 00:28:24,408
The bacteria must've got in
through the cut on your thigh.

624
00:28:24,492 --> 00:28:25,826
It's rare, but it happens.

625
00:28:25,910 --> 00:28:27,912
Do you know what it's like
to be invisible?

626
00:28:27,995 --> 00:28:30,623
Well, if there were any other option,
we would tell you. I promise, Judith.

627
00:28:30,706 --> 00:28:33,376
- [beeping continues]
- Judith? Judith? Judith?

628
00:28:33,459 --> 00:28:35,836
Damn it. She's septic.
Come on. Come on. Come on.

629
00:28:36,337 --> 00:28:37,588
Okay, let's go. Let's move.

630
00:28:41,217 --> 00:28:43,219
- Where am I?
- Mr. Riley, hold on. I got you.

631
00:28:43,302 --> 00:28:46,055
- I need a hand in here. Griffith!
- [nurse] He started crashing a minute ago.

632
00:28:46,138 --> 00:28:47,056
I need to intubate.

633
00:28:47,139 --> 00:28:50,142
- Push 30 of etomidate and 150 of sux.
- [nurse 2] On it.

634
00:28:50,226 --> 00:28:52,395
- Where is Griffith?
- [nurse] I got the intubation tray.

635
00:28:52,478 --> 00:28:55,481
All right. Let's get you some air.
Here we go. Here we go.

636
00:28:56,273 --> 00:28:57,358
Okay. Come on.

637
00:28:59,110 --> 00:29:00,403
Damn it.

638
00:29:00,486 --> 00:29:02,488
Helm. Helm, get in here.

639
00:29:04,657 --> 00:29:06,409
I need you to apply cricoid pressure.

640
00:29:06,492 --> 00:29:07,701
- There?
- Higher.

641
00:29:08,202 --> 00:29:10,705
Higher. Right there, right there.
There we go. I'm in.

642
00:29:10,788 --> 00:29:12,081
All right.

643
00:29:12,164 --> 00:29:13,165
Come on.

644
00:29:15,960 --> 00:29:17,920
His sats aren't improving.
We need to get him on ECMO

645
00:29:18,003 --> 00:29:20,631
before the hypoxemia puts too much
stress on his heart and he codes.

646
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:22,466
I need an ECMO machine right now!

647
00:29:35,229 --> 00:29:37,606
[panting] What happened?

648
00:29:37,690 --> 00:29:39,316
He was intubated,
but he wasn't oxygenating.

649
00:29:39,400 --> 00:29:41,402
You'd know that
if you were monitoring like I asked.

650
00:29:41,485 --> 00:29:43,320
I'm sorry. I ran down to
the emergency room to check...

651
00:29:43,404 --> 00:29:45,156
I don't wanna hear it. Wait outside.

652
00:29:45,239 --> 00:29:46,699
Helm, get the tube ready.

653
00:29:54,498 --> 00:29:57,334
[Atticus] Okay.
I hit a pocket of fluid. Suction.

654
00:29:58,419 --> 00:29:59,754
[all groan]

655
00:29:59,837 --> 00:30:02,798
[Benson grunts] She's gonna be devastated
when she wakes up and it's all gone.

656
00:30:02,882 --> 00:30:05,217
- At least she'll still be here.
- [Owen] If we can work fast enough.

657
00:30:05,301 --> 00:30:07,803
We're gonna need another set of hands.
Warren, you ready to get in here?

658
00:30:07,887 --> 00:30:09,305
Sure. Scalpel.

659
00:30:12,850 --> 00:30:14,226
Good. Quick and intentional.

660
00:30:15,311 --> 00:30:16,604
I can help if you need it.

661
00:30:16,687 --> 00:30:18,147
Just keep up with the suction.

662
00:30:20,441 --> 00:30:22,443
Actually, you know,
I could use a hand in here.

663
00:30:22,526 --> 00:30:25,029
Uh, Kwan, you wanna help break up
some of this tissue?

664
00:30:25,112 --> 00:30:26,113
Yeah.

665
00:30:30,534 --> 00:30:32,161
Oh, I see healthy tissue.

666
00:30:32,244 --> 00:30:33,829
[stammers] Yep, there it is.

667
00:30:33,913 --> 00:30:35,414
Bleeding edges.

668
00:30:35,498 --> 00:30:37,458
Nice work, boss.

669
00:30:37,541 --> 00:30:40,211
Moving on to the superior aspect
of the thigh.

670
00:30:41,170 --> 00:30:42,963
[Lucas sighs] Last one.

671
00:30:43,589 --> 00:30:45,674
Do you remember your med school cadaver?

672
00:30:45,758 --> 00:30:48,761
Yeah. Sixty-eight-year-old female,
lungs full of mets.

673
00:30:48,844 --> 00:30:50,346
Uh, we assumed she was a smoker.

674
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:54,100
Named her Marge
and decided she was a trucker.

675
00:30:54,767 --> 00:30:55,768
Mine was my grandma.

676
00:30:56,435 --> 00:30:59,271
Uh, wait, you, uh, dissected
your grandmother?

677
00:30:59,355 --> 00:31:01,899
What? God, no. No, no.

678
00:31:01,982 --> 00:31:06,821
My... My dad's mom died before I was born,
and my mom really hated her.

679
00:31:06,904 --> 00:31:09,407
So I... I kinda grew up without a grandma.

680
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:13,994
But we had been dissecting our cadaver
for weeks

681
00:31:14,078 --> 00:31:16,330
before we finally took the towel
off her face.

682
00:31:16,414 --> 00:31:18,416
And I remember looking at her
and thinking,

683
00:31:19,458 --> 00:31:20,584
"She could be my grandma."

684
00:31:20,668 --> 00:31:25,297
And I just hoped
that she didn't feel alone.

685
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:29,427
I hoped she felt that she was surrounded
by people who truly appreciated her.

686
00:31:30,594 --> 00:31:31,846
I, uh...

687
00:31:32,430 --> 00:31:34,640
I never thought about it
that way. [chuckles]

688
00:31:34,724 --> 00:31:35,725
Yeah.

689
00:31:35,808 --> 00:31:38,269
And then we cut open her neck
and her head and finished...

690
00:31:40,855 --> 00:31:42,148
Um...

691
00:31:42,231 --> 00:31:44,483
Could you transfer the scans
to the CDs by yourself?

692
00:31:44,567 --> 00:31:46,902
[stutters] There's something
I really need to do.

693
00:31:46,986 --> 00:31:48,028
Yeah?

694
00:31:48,112 --> 00:31:49,488
Yeah, okay.

695
00:31:49,572 --> 00:31:51,073
[â™ª "Don't Let Go" playing]

696
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:58,706
â™ª <i>We've made it through winter</i> â™ª

697
00:31:59,206 --> 00:32:00,207
[clears throat]

698
00:32:00,291 --> 00:32:02,918
Hey, any, uh, news...
[chuckles] ...from the pit?

699
00:32:03,002 --> 00:32:05,087
Just... Uh, how is he?

700
00:32:05,171 --> 00:32:06,422
He's on ECMO and stable.

701
00:32:06,505 --> 00:32:08,591
But I don't know
if he'll ever breathe on his own again.

702
00:32:08,674 --> 00:32:09,675
I'm so sorry.

703
00:32:09,759 --> 00:32:12,428
What were you doing in the ER
when my patients are up here?

704
00:32:12,511 --> 00:32:13,679
Please explain that to me.

705
00:32:13,763 --> 00:32:16,974
- Um, why don't we take a breath?
- I'm breathing just fine, thank you.

706
00:32:17,058 --> 00:32:19,727
I was checking on a patient
for a colleague, and I...

707
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:21,228
- In the ER?
- Dr. Ndugu...

708
00:32:21,312 --> 00:32:22,313
Dr. Bailey, hold on.

709
00:32:22,396 --> 00:32:24,648
If-If I can't trust you
to follow simple instructions,

710
00:32:24,732 --> 00:32:25,941
I can't have you on my service.

711
00:32:26,025 --> 00:32:29,320
- Dr. Ndugu, I need a word in private.
- I asked you to step in because I...

Wait. Excuse me.

[Jules sighs]

Hi. I'm Jules. We met this morning.

724
00:33:10,194 --> 00:33:11,529
I'm one of the interns.

725
00:33:11,612 --> 00:33:13,072
I know who you are.

726

â™ª <i>Follow you, follow you</i> â™ª

728
00:33:51,652 --> 00:33:56,240
Okay. I asked Griffith to check on
a patient in the emergency room.

729
00:33:56,323 --> 00:34:00,244
I didn't realize
that your patient was borderline critical.

730
00:34:00,327 --> 00:34:02,246
She knew. She should've said no.

731
00:34:02,830 --> 00:34:04,415
I'm her boss, right?

732
00:34:04,498 --> 00:34:06,000
It's not her fault.

733
00:34:07,251 --> 00:34:10,087
Why did you send her downstairs?
You're not working there today.

734
00:34:10,713 --> 00:34:12,715
[stammers] I don't know. I...

735
00:34:12,798 --> 00:34:15,718
[inhales sharply]
First day back in a while.

736
00:34:15,801 --> 00:34:21,223
I wanted to see how things were going,
that's all.

737
00:34:21,307 --> 00:34:25,311
Okay. Take it from the guy who married
and then divorced his boss.

738
00:34:25,394 --> 00:34:27,104
Get out of your husband's way.

739
00:34:27,188 --> 00:34:28,606
Uh, I beg your pardon?

740
00:34:28,689 --> 00:34:30,691
I'm saying at home, you need to be a team.

741
00:34:30,775 --> 00:34:33,277
At work, let him be his own person.

742
00:34:38,783 --> 00:34:39,784
Hey. I'm sorry.

743
00:34:39,867 --> 00:34:42,495
- I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.
- The appointment was at 5:00, right?

744
00:34:42,578 --> 00:34:45,414
[sighs] I know. I just got so busy
with patients. I completely forgot.

745
00:34:45,498 --> 00:34:48,250
You don't have to apologize.
DeLuca had to leave.

746
00:34:48,334 --> 00:34:51,212
- We were gonna see the baby.
- Yeah, we'll just reschedule.

747
00:34:52,380 --> 00:34:53,881
Wait. Come with me. [chuckles]

00:34:57,968 --> 00:35:00,596
Judith, how are you feeling?

751
00:35:00,679 --> 00:35:02,181
You really have to ask?

752
00:35:02,264 --> 00:35:04,308
[chuckles] You should
be feeling better soon.

753
00:35:04,392 --> 00:35:06,227
We were able to remove
the infected tissue.

754
00:35:06,310 --> 00:35:08,479
And we'll keep you in the ICU
for a few more days

755
00:35:08,562 --> 00:35:11,148
to wash out the wound and make sure
there's no more necrotic tissue.

756
00:35:11,732 --> 00:35:13,484
Okay, trauma. Kwan, come with me.

757
00:35:13,567 --> 00:35:15,361
Check on the cultures,
and we'll see you downstairs.

758
00:35:15,444 --> 00:35:17,655
Judith, I will come check on you soon,
okay?

762
00:35:28,124 --> 00:35:30,751
But I've learned when it feels
like you're losing ground,

763
00:35:30,835 --> 00:35:32,420
you're still moving forward.

764
00:35:33,003 --> 00:35:35,840
Everything you've learned,
everything you've experienced,

765
00:35:35,923 --> 00:35:37,174
it all comes with you.

766
00:35:37,258 --> 00:35:39,510
I can tell you what's not coming with me.

767
00:35:40,010 --> 00:35:42,179
The $8,000 I spent on my butt.

768
00:35:42,930 --> 00:35:46,767
No, but all that confidence you gained
after the lift,

769
00:35:47,351 --> 00:35:48,561
we didn't take any of that.

770
00:35:49,478 --> 00:35:51,480
Are you saying I have big butt energy?

771
00:35:51,564 --> 00:35:54,692
- [laughs] I'm saying all is not lost.
- [Judith chuckles]

772
00:35:55,651 --> 00:35:58,446
But if down the road
you decide you want reconstruction,

773
00:35:58,529 --> 00:36:00,740
[clicks tongue] I know
a great plastic surgeon in Boston.

774
00:36:01,407 --> 00:36:02,491
Now you're talking.

775
00:36:02,575 --> 00:36:03,868

â™ª <i>Why I had to go through that</i> â™ª

780
00:36:17,423 --> 00:36:20,092
She's doing well.
There were no complications.

781
00:36:20,176 --> 00:36:22,636
And Dr. Webber says she should be able
to go home soon.

782
00:36:24,472 --> 00:36:28,309
I'm sorry... [sighs] ...for what I said
earlier. Sometimes I can be such a...

783

Thank you for sitting with her.

784
00:36:32,313 --> 00:36:34,565
You have no idea
how much that meant to her.

785
00:36:36,901 --> 00:36:38,152
How much it meant to me.

786
00:36:39,070 --> 00:36:41,322
Well, I knew you couldn't do it, so...

787
00:36:42,615 --> 00:36:44,366
Didn't want her to be alone.

788
00:36:49,455 --> 00:36:50,456
Oh. [sighs]

789

You know, it's not easy to watch
someone you love fight cancer.

792

Yeah, I know.

801

Adams, they have this covered.

Hey, hey! Show some respect.

803
00:37:34,625 --> 00:37:37,420
These people donated their bodies
so that future doctors

804
00:37:37,503 --> 00:37:40,923
could learn how to help others
live longer, healthier lives.

805
00:37:41,006 --> 00:37:42,007
Okay. Sorry.

806
00:37:43,759 --> 00:37:44,760
I wanted to help.

807
00:37:53,394 --> 00:37:55,438
Hey. Oh, aren't you supposed
to be getting the kids?

808
00:37:55,521 --> 00:37:57,940
Yeah, well,
I thought we could grab a bite first.

809
00:37:58,023 --> 00:38:00,526
Oh, I can, uh, either eat with you
or feed the kids,

810
00:38:00,609 --> 00:38:02,153
but I don't have time for both.

811
00:38:04,488 --> 00:38:06,407
- Do you not feel this?
- Feel what?

812
00:38:06,490 --> 00:38:09,827
Ever since we got rehired, we haven't
had a single meal alone together.

813
00:38:09,910 --> 00:38:12,747
We haven't had a conversation
that wasn't about surgery

814
00:38:12,830 --> 00:38:14,832
or the kids' schedules
in almost three weeks.

815
00:38:14,915 --> 00:38:16,125
Well, work has been busy.

816
00:38:16,208 --> 00:38:18,711
But, you know,
we'll get back on track eventually.

817
00:38:20,046 --> 00:38:21,047
It's just... [grunts]

818
00:38:22,381 --> 00:38:24,133
It feels like we're not connecting,
you know?

819
00:38:24,216 --> 00:38:27,303
It feels like there's something
eating away at this relationship.

820
00:38:27,386 --> 00:38:29,638
And I... I know I stepped in it
more than once today...

821
00:38:29,722 --> 00:38:32,558
No, it's... it's not just you.
