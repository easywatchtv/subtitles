They lied to me.

It's embarrassing.

Hi, Trevor. Trevor Slattery.

1722

A bit smaller. Everyone says that.

1724

But I do know it's happening
off the coast.

1734
01:30:02,270 --> 01:30:05,672

the vice president as well.

Didn't you say something
about a "lovely speedboat"?

1747
01:30:36,350 --> 01:30:38,830
If he's right about the location,
we're 20 minutes from where Pepper is.

1748
01:30:38,990 --> 01:30:40,037
But we also have to figure out this

1749

- vice president thing, right?
- Right.

1750
01:30:41,950 --> 01:30:43,190
I wonder who I'm calling right now.

1751
01:30:43,270 --> 01:30:44,470
Oh! That's the vice president.

Welcome back to the land of the living.

RHODEY: <i>Sir, this is Colonel Rhodes.</i>

1763
01:31:07,310 --> 01:31:09,230
They're using the Iron Patriot
as a Trojan horse.

<i>They're gonna take out
the president somehow.</i>

1765
01:31:10,950 --> 01:31:12,511
We have to immediately
alert that plane.

1766
01:31:12,670 --> 01:31:14,718
Okay, I'm on it.
I'll have security lock it down.

1767
01:31:14,790 --> 01:31:17,714
If need be, they can have
F-22s in the air in 30 seconds.

1768
01:31:17,870 --> 01:31:19,630
- Thank you, Colonel.
- Rhodes and Stark out.

I feel safer already.

RHODEY:
We gotta make a decision.

1775
01:32:04,910 --> 01:32:07,720
We can either save the president,
or Pepper. We can't do both.

You said you wanted the Mandarin.

2062
01:52:52,270 --> 01:52:54,955
You're looking right at him.

2063
01:52:55,310 --> 01:52:58,314
It was always me, Tony.
Right from the start.

2064
01:52:58,790 --> 01:53:00,474
I am the Mandarin!

2077
01:54:04,470 --> 01:54:06,154
Oh, my God.

2078
01:54:07,710 --> 01:54:09,917
That was really violent.

2079
01:54:10,910 --> 01:54:12,912
You just scared the devil out of me.
I thought you were...

2080
01:54:13,070 --> 01:54:15,118
I was dead.
Why? Because I fell 200 feet?

2081
01:54:18,590 --> 01:54:20,274
Who's the hot mess now?

2082
01:54:20,430 --> 01:54:22,512
It's still debatable.

2083
01:54:23,070 --> 01:54:24,356
Probably tipping your way a little bit.

2084
01:54:24,430 --> 01:54:26,478
Why don't you dress
like this at home? Hmm?

2085
01:54:26,550 --> 01:54:28,473
Sport bra. The whole deal.

2086
01:54:28,550 --> 01:54:31,759
You know, I think I understand
why you don't want to give up the suits.

2087
01:54:31,950 --> 01:54:34,476
What am I going to complain
about now?

2088
01:54:35,310 --> 01:54:36,960
Well, it's me.

2089
01:54:37,750 --> 01:54:38,797
You'll think of something.

2090
01:54:40,350 --> 01:54:41,761
- No, don't touch me.
- Don't worry about it.

2091
01:54:41,830 --> 01:54:43,753
- No, I'm gonna burn you.
- No, you're not.

2092
01:54:44,790 --> 01:54:45,791
Not hot.

2093
01:54:47,190 --> 01:54:48,874
Am I gonna be okay?

2094
01:54:48,950 --> 01:54:49,951
No.

2095
01:54:50,030 --> 01:54:52,761
You're in a relationship with me.
Everything will never be okay.

2096
01:54:53,030 --> 01:54:54,873
But I think I can figure this out, yeah.

2097
01:54:55,110 --> 01:54:56,839
I almost had this 20 years ago
when I was drunk.

2098
01:54:56,910 --> 01:55:00,039
I think I can get you better.

2099

That's what I do. I fix stuff.

2101
01:55:06,110 --> 01:55:08,192
Uh... I'm going to shave them down
a little bit.

Will there be anything else?</i>

2104
01:55:14,430 --> 01:55:16,398

"Why stop there?"</i>
