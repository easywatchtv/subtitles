1
00:01:35,324 --> 00:01:37,233
Time to get up, man.

2
00:01:39,078 --> 00:01:41,367
- All right, Dad.
- Come on.

3
00:02:49,231 --> 00:02:51,058
Should be here soon.

4
00:03:38,447 --> 00:03:40,736
- I think I should make a list.
- What do you mean?

5
00:03:40,950 --> 00:03:43,322
- For your birthday gifts?
- Yeah.

6
00:03:43,536 --> 00:03:46,074
You know you're only getting
a couple of things, right?

7
00:03:46,288 --> 00:03:50,333
Yeah, I know. Just to look at
and study so I can choose better.

8
00:03:50,543 --> 00:03:53,460
Okay, well, that's smart.
Yeah, make a list.

9
00:03:53,963 --> 00:03:55,872
Can you spell everything
you're thinking of?

10
00:03:56,090 --> 00:03:59,673
- I think so.
- All right. That's good.

11
00:04:03,639 --> 00:04:06,510
- How you doing in here, man?
- Okay.

12
00:04:13,774 --> 00:04:16,728
Can we go to the park today, after?

13
00:04:17,528 --> 00:04:20,979
No, I gotta go to Oakland.
Well, maybe, we'll see.

14
00:04:21,198 --> 00:04:22,776
Give me a kiss.

15
00:04:23,659 --> 00:04:25,533
I'll talk to you later.

16
00:04:28,956 --> 00:04:30,616
Excuse me.

17
00:04:31,417 --> 00:04:33,125
Oh, excuse me...

18
00:04:33,336 --> 00:04:35,624
...when is somebody
gonna clean this off?

19
00:04:38,633 --> 00:04:41,170
And the Y?
The Y. We talked about this.

20
00:04:41,385 --> 00:04:44,801
It's an I in "happiness."
There's no Y in "happiness." It's an I.

21
00:04:47,099 --> 00:04:48,973
<i>I'm Chris Gardner.</i>

22
00:04:49,393 --> 00:04:52,478
<i>I met my father for the first time</i>
<i>when I was 28 years old.</i>

23
00:04:53,272 --> 00:04:54,932
<i>And I made up my mind</i>
<i>as a young kid...</i>

24
00:04:55,149 --> 00:04:56,643
<i>... that when I had children...</i>

25
00:04:56,859 --> 00:05:00,193
<i>... my children were gonna know</i>
<i>who their father was.</i>

26
00:05:02,073 --> 00:05:04,824
<i>This is part of my life story.</i>

27
00:05:05,618 --> 00:05:08,987
<i>This part is called "Riding the Bus."</i>

28
00:05:15,503 --> 00:05:17,163
What's that?

29
00:05:17,755 --> 00:05:19,997
It's a time machine, isn't it?

30
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,377
Seems like a time machine.

31
00:05:22,593 --> 00:05:25,677
That seems like a time machine.
It's a time machine. Take me with you.

32
00:05:25,888 --> 00:05:27,086
<i>This machine...</i>

33
00:05:27,556 --> 00:05:28,801
<i>... this machine on my lap...</i>

34
00:05:29,016 --> 00:05:30,973
This guy, he has a time machine.

35
00:05:31,185 --> 00:05:34,221
He travels in the past
with this machine and...

36
00:05:34,438 --> 00:05:36,680
- <i>it is not a time machine.</i>

37
00:05:37,233 --> 00:05:39,854
<i>It's a portable</i>
<i>bone-density scanner.</i>

38
00:05:40,695 --> 00:05:43,316
<i>A medical device I sell for a living.</i>

39
00:05:43,531 --> 00:05:46,022
Thank you for the opportunity
to discuss it with you.

40
00:05:46,242 --> 00:05:48,318
- I appreciate it.
- We just don't need it, Chris.

41
00:05:48,536 --> 00:05:50,279
It's unnecessary and expensive.

42
00:05:50,496 --> 00:05:52,619
- Well, maybe next...
- Thank you.

43
00:05:53,708 --> 00:05:58,785
<i>It gave a slightly denser picture</i>
<i>than an x-ray for twice the money.</i>

44
00:06:01,799 --> 00:06:03,377
- Hey.
- Hey, baby.

45
00:06:03,592 --> 00:06:05,252
- What happened?
- No, nothing.

46
00:06:05,469 --> 00:06:07,047
Look, I can't get Christopher today.

47
00:06:07,596 --> 00:06:09,755
Oh, no, you don't, Chris.
I'm back on at 7.

48
00:06:09,974 --> 00:06:11,717
I know. I have got to go to Oakland.

49
00:06:12,184 --> 00:06:15,055
So I gotta get Christopher home,
feed him, bathe him...

50
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:17,892
...get him in bed,
and be back here by 7?

51
00:06:18,107 --> 00:06:20,230
- Yes.
- And we got the tax-bill notice today.

52
00:06:20,443 --> 00:06:23,942
- What are you gonna do about that?
- Look, this is what we gotta do.

53
00:06:28,284 --> 00:06:32,447
<i>You see that car? The one</i>
<i>with the pretty yellow shoe on it?</i>

54
00:06:32,663 --> 00:06:34,039
<i>That's mine.</i>

55
00:06:34,248 --> 00:06:36,205
<i>There's no parking near hospitals.</i>

56
00:06:36,417 --> 00:06:38,908
<i>That's what happens</i>
<i>when you're always in a rush.</i>

57
00:06:39,128 --> 00:06:41,002
Thanks anyway. Very much.

58
00:06:41,213 --> 00:06:44,131
- Maybe next quarter.
- It's possible.

59
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:50,549
<i>I needed to sell at least two scanners</i>
<i>a month for rent and daycare.</i>

60
00:06:51,432 --> 00:06:52,760
<i>I'd have to sell one more...</i>

61
00:06:52,975 --> 00:06:56,759
<i>... to pay off all of those tickets</i>
<i>under my windshield wiper.</i>

62
00:07:03,569 --> 00:07:05,562
<i>The problem is...</i>

63
00:07:06,489 --> 00:07:08,944
<i>... I haven't sold any for a while.</i>

64
00:07:10,660 --> 00:07:13,329
Since when do you not like
macaroni and cheese?

65
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:16,075
Since birth?

66
00:07:18,542 --> 00:07:20,582
- What's that?
- What?

67
00:07:20,795 --> 00:07:23,879
- What is this?
- It's a gift for Christopher.

68
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:26,581
- From who?
- Cynthia from work.

69
00:07:26,801 --> 00:07:29,885
It's for adults. Chris can't use it.
She didn't know.

70
00:07:30,096 --> 00:07:32,088
What are you supposed
to do with it?

71
00:07:32,807 --> 00:07:35,891
Make every side the same colour.

72
00:07:37,186 --> 00:07:39,475
Did you pay the taxes?

73
00:07:39,772 --> 00:07:42,892
No, I'm gonna
have to file an extension.

74
00:07:43,693 --> 00:07:47,821
- You already filed an extension.
- Yeah, well, I gotta file another one.

75
00:07:48,197 --> 00:07:51,898
That's... It's $650.
I'll have it in the next month.

76
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,236
That means interest, right?

77
00:07:54,453 --> 00:07:56,825
- And a penalty?
- Yeah, a little bit.

78
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:02,663
Look, why don't you let me do this?
All right, just relax. Okay?

79
00:08:02,878 --> 00:08:07,007
- Come here. Calm down.
- I have to go back to work.

80
00:08:15,057 --> 00:08:18,675
Let's get ready for bed.
Hey, put your plate in the sink.

81
00:08:19,395 --> 00:08:22,312
<i>A few days ago I was presented</i>
<i>with a report I'd asked for...</i>

82
00:08:22,523 --> 00:08:26,224
<i>... a comprehensive audit, if you will,</i>
<i>of our economic condition.</i>

83
00:08:26,902 --> 00:08:29,654
<i>You won't like it. I didn't like it.</i>

84
00:08:29,864 --> 00:08:31,524
<i>But we have to face the truth...</i>

85
00:08:31,741 --> 00:08:34,362
<i>... and then go to work</i>
<i>to turn things around.</i>

86
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:38,325
<i>And make no mistake about it,</i>
<i>we can turn them around.</i>

87
00:08:38,539 --> 00:08:41,623
<i>The federal budget is out of control.</i>

88
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:45,203
<i>And we face runaway deficits</i>
<i>of almost $80 billion...</i>

89
00:08:45,421 --> 00:08:48,837
<i>... for this budget year</i>
<i>that ends September 30th.</i>

90
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:54,257
<i>That deficit is larger than</i>
<i>the entire federal budget in 1957.</i>

91
00:08:54,472 --> 00:08:57,045
<i>And so is the almost $80 billion...</i>

92
00:08:57,266 --> 00:09:01,560
<i>... we will pay in interest</i>
<i>this year on the national debt.</i>

93
00:09:02,188 --> 00:09:04,726
<i>Twenty years ago, in 1960...</i>

94
00:09:04,940 --> 00:09:09,069
<i>... our federal government payroll</i>
<i>was less than $13 billion.</i>

95
00:09:09,278 --> 00:09:11,983
<i>Today it is 75 billion.</i>

96
00:09:12,198 --> 00:09:17,738
<i>During these 20 years, our population</i>
<i>has only increased by 23.3 percent...</i>

97
00:09:35,930 --> 00:09:38,682
Man, I got two questions for you:

98
00:09:38,891 --> 00:09:42,011
What do you do?
And how do you do it?

99
00:09:43,521 --> 00:09:46,605
- I'm a stockbroker.
- Stockbroker. Oh, goodness.

100
00:09:46,816 --> 00:09:48,773
Had to go to college
to be a stockbroker, huh?

101
00:09:49,068 --> 00:09:52,769
You don't have to. Have to be good
with numbers and good with people.

102
00:09:52,989 --> 00:09:55,361
- That's it.
- Hey, you take care.

103
00:09:55,574 --> 00:09:57,614
I'll let you hang on to my car
for the weekend.

104
00:09:57,827 --> 00:10:00,282
- But I need it back for Monday.
- Feed the meter.

105
00:10:07,503 --> 00:10:09,875
<i>I still remember that moment.</i>

106
00:10:14,176 --> 00:10:18,803
<i>They all looked</i>
<i>so damn happy to me.</i>

107
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:28,394
<i>Why couldn't I look like that?</i>

108
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,328
I'm gonna try to get home by 6.

109
00:10:47,543 --> 00:10:50,663
I'm gonna stop by a brokerage firm
after work.

110
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,165
- For what?
- I wanna see about a job there.

111
00:10:54,383 --> 00:10:57,005
Yeah? What job?

112
00:10:57,511 --> 00:10:59,504
You know, when I...

113
00:10:59,722 --> 00:11:02,343
When I was a kid, I could go through
a math book in a week.

114
00:11:02,558 --> 00:11:05,892
So I'm gonna go see about
what job they got down there.

115
00:11:07,021 --> 00:11:08,930
What job?

116
00:11:11,901 --> 00:11:13,644
Stockbroker.

117
00:11:15,946 --> 00:11:19,150
- Stockbroker?
- Yeah.

118
00:11:19,575 --> 00:11:21,532
Not an astronaut?

119
00:11:38,552 --> 00:11:40,047
Don't talk to me like that, Linda.

120
00:11:41,180 --> 00:11:44,964
I'm gonna go down and see about this,
and I'm gonna do it during the day.

121
00:11:45,184 --> 00:11:46,892
You should probably
do your sales calls.

122
00:11:47,353 --> 00:11:49,761
I don't need you to tell me
about my sales calls, Linda.

123
00:11:49,981 --> 00:11:53,184
I got three of them
before the damn office is even open.

124
00:11:53,734 --> 00:11:56,142
Do you remember
that rent is due next week?

125
00:11:56,362 --> 00:11:58,236
Probably not.

126
00:11:58,864 --> 00:12:00,904
We're already two months behind.

127
00:12:01,117 --> 00:12:04,153
Next week we'll owe three months.

128
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:08,748
I've been pulling double shifts
for four months now, Chris.

129
00:12:09,166 --> 00:12:13,460
Just sell what's in your contract.
Get us out of that business.

130
00:12:13,671 --> 00:12:17,371
Linda, that is what I am trying to do.

131
00:12:18,134 --> 00:12:20,803
This is what I'm trying to do
for my family...

132
00:12:21,012 --> 00:12:22,387
...for you and for Christopher.

133
00:12:23,806 --> 00:12:25,929
What's the matter with you?

134
00:12:30,104 --> 00:12:31,764
Linda.

135
00:12:32,356 --> 00:12:33,898
Linda.

136
00:13:00,885 --> 00:13:05,962
<i>This part of my life</i>
<i>is called "Being Stupid."</i>

137
00:13:08,017 --> 00:13:09,297
Can I ask you a favour, miss?

138
00:13:09,518 --> 00:13:13,386
Do you mind if I leave this here
with you just for five minutes?

139
00:13:13,606 --> 00:13:16,097
I have a meeting in there
and I don't wanna carry that...

140
00:13:16,317 --> 00:13:18,309
...looking smalltime.

141
00:13:19,153 --> 00:13:23,614
Here is a dollar and I'll give you
more money when I come back out.

142
00:13:23,824 --> 00:13:27,074
Okay? It's not valuable.
You can't sell it anywhere.

143
00:13:28,037 --> 00:13:33,162
I can't even sell it, and it's my job.
All right? Be right back.

144
00:13:39,882 --> 00:13:42,207
- Chris? Tim Brophy, Resources.
- Yes. How are you?

145
00:13:42,426 --> 00:13:43,755
- Follow me.
- Yes, sir.

146
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:46,721
Let me see if I can find you
an application for our internship.

147
00:13:46,931 --> 00:13:50,181
I'm afraid that's all we can do for you.
See, this is a satellite office.

148
00:13:50,393 --> 00:13:53,014
Jay Twistle in the main office,
he oversees Witter Resources.

149
00:13:53,229 --> 00:13:55,352
I mean, I'm... You know,
I'm just this office.

150
00:13:55,564 --> 00:13:58,482
As you can see, we got a hell of lot
of applications here, so...

151
00:13:58,693 --> 00:14:01,693
Normally I have a résumé sheet,
but I can't seem to find it anywhere.

152
00:14:01,904 --> 00:14:05,320
- <i>We...</i>
- Thank you very much.

153
00:14:05,533 --> 00:14:06,695
I need to go.

154
00:14:07,284 --> 00:14:08,992
I'll bring this back.

155
00:14:09,245 --> 00:14:12,365
- Thank you.
- Okay.

156
00:14:18,754 --> 00:14:23,215
<i>Trusting a hippie girl with my scanner.</i>
<i>Why did I do that?</i>

157
00:14:23,426 --> 00:14:25,050
Excuse me. Excuse me.

158
00:14:25,261 --> 00:14:30,717

<i>There were three blank lines after</i>
<i>"high school" to list more education.</i>

166
00:15:25,071 --> 00:15:27,858
<i>I didn't need that many lines.</i>

167
00:15:32,953 --> 00:15:35,954
Try and sleep. It's late.

168
00:15:45,925 --> 00:15:49,508
<i>It's a puzzle measuring just 3 inches</i>
<i>by 3 inches on each side...</i>

169
00:15:49,720 --> 00:15:52,128
<i>... made up of multiple colours</i>
<i>that you twist and turn...</i>

170
00:15:52,348 --> 00:15:54,969
<i>... and try to get</i>
<i>to a solid colour on each side.</i>

171
00:15:55,184 --> 00:15:58,802
<i>This little cube</i>
<i>is the gift sensation of 1981.</i>

172
00:15:59,021 --> 00:16:00,397
<i>Don't expect to solve it easily.</i>

173
00:16:00,606 --> 00:16:03,014
<i>Although we did encounter</i>
<i>one math professor at USF...</i>

174
00:16:03,234 --> 00:16:05,725
<i>... who took just 30 minutes on his.</i>

175
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:08,151
<i>This is as far as I've gotten</i>
<i>on mine.</i>

176
00:16:08,364 --> 00:16:11,733
<i>As you can see,</i>
<i>I still have a long way to go.</i>

177
00:16:11,951 --> 00:16:14,572
<i>This is Jim Finnerty reporting</i>
<i>for KJSF in Richmond.</i>

178
00:16:14,787 --> 00:16:17,492
Hey, wake up.

179
00:16:17,707 --> 00:16:19,201
Eat.

180
00:16:20,334 --> 00:16:22,790
- Bye, Mom.
- Bye, baby.

181
00:16:23,004 --> 00:16:26,004
- Come back without that, please.
- Oh, yeah, I'm going to.

182
00:16:26,215 --> 00:16:29,133
So go ahead, say goodbye to it,
because I'm coming back without it.

183
00:16:29,343 --> 00:16:31,751
Goodbye and good riddance.

184
00:16:31,971 --> 00:16:33,928
You ain't had to add
the "good riddance" part.

185
00:16:34,140 --> 00:16:35,171
Bye, Mom.

186
00:16:36,726 --> 00:16:38,054
Bye.

187
00:16:38,269 --> 00:16:41,852
It's written as P-P-Y, but it's
supposed to be an I in "happiness."

188
00:16:42,064 --> 00:16:45,184
- Is it an adjective?
- No, actually it's a noun.

189
00:16:45,401 --> 00:16:47,144
But it's not spelled right.

190
00:16:47,361 --> 00:16:50,944
- Is "fuck" spelled right?
- Yeah, that's spelled right.

191
00:16:51,157 --> 00:16:54,276
But that's not part of the motto,
so you're not supposed to learn that.

192
00:16:54,493 --> 00:16:59,369
That's an adult word to show anger
and other things.

193
00:16:59,582 --> 00:17:02,452
- But just don't use that one, okay?
- Okay.

194
00:17:02,668 --> 00:17:04,827
What's that say
on the back of your bag?

195
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:07,128
My nickname.

196
00:17:07,340 --> 00:17:08,917
We pick nicknames.

197
00:17:09,133 --> 00:17:12,502
- Oh, yeah? What's it say?
- "Hot Rod."

198
00:17:15,514 --> 00:17:17,554
- Did you have a nickname?
- Yep.

199
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:20,471
- What?
- "Ten-Gallon Head."

200
00:17:20,686 --> 00:17:23,557
- What's that?
- I grew up in Louisiana, near Texas.

201
00:17:23,773 --> 00:17:28,399
Everybody wears cowboy hats.
And a ten-gallon's a big hat.

202
00:17:28,611 --> 00:17:32,194
I was smart back then,
so they called me Ten-Gallon Head.

203
00:17:32,782 --> 00:17:34,905
- Hoss wears that hat.
- Hoss?

204
00:17:35,201 --> 00:17:36,909
Hoss Cartwright on <i>Bonanza.</i>

205
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,904
- How do you know <i>Bonanza?</i>
- We watch it at Mrs. Chu's.

206
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:44,666
- You watch <i>Bonanza</i> at daycare?
- Yeah.

207
00:17:45,753 --> 00:17:47,793
When? When do you watch it?

208
00:17:48,005 --> 00:17:51,670
- After snack? After your nap?
- After <i>Love Boat.</i>

209
00:17:56,597 --> 00:17:58,756
I made my list for my birthday.

210
00:17:59,517 --> 00:18:04,060
- Yeah, what'd you put on there?
- A basketball or an ant farm.

211
00:18:07,650 --> 00:18:11,944
- He says he's been watching TV.
- Oh, little TV for history.

212
00:18:12,154 --> 00:18:15,239
- <i>Love Boat?</i>
- For history. Navy.

213
00:18:15,950 --> 00:18:17,693
That's not the Navy.

214
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:20,033
I mean, he could
watch television at home.

215
00:18:20,246 --> 00:18:24,623
We're paying you $150 a month.
If he's gonna be sitting around...

216
00:18:24,834 --> 00:18:27,206
...watching TV all day,
we're taking him out of here.

217
00:18:27,420 --> 00:18:31,204
Go pay more at other daycare
if you don't like Navy TV.

218
00:18:33,092 --> 00:18:38,299
You late pay anyway.
You complain. I complain.

219
00:18:39,807 --> 00:18:43,591
Can you at least put the dog upstairs
in your room or something?

220
00:18:43,811 --> 00:18:45,270
Bye.

221
00:19:29,649 --> 00:19:33,516
<i>I was waiting for</i>
<i>Witter Resource head Jay Twistle...</i>

222
00:19:33,778 --> 00:19:39,282
<i>... whose name sounded so delightful,</i>
<i>like he’d give me a job and a hug.</i>

223
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:43,489
<i>I just had to show him I was good</i>
<i>with numbers and good with people.</i>

224
00:19:43,704 --> 00:19:45,246
- Morning, Mr. Twistle.
- Good morning.

225
00:19:45,456 --> 00:19:46,867
- Mr. Twistle, Chris Gardner.
- Hi.

226
00:19:47,083 --> 00:19:49,870
I wanted to drop this off personally
and make your acquaintance.

227
00:19:50,086 --> 00:19:53,455
I thought I'd catch you on the way in.
I'd love the opportunity to discuss...

228
00:19:53,673 --> 00:19:55,879
...what may seem like weaknesses
on my application.

229
00:19:56,092 --> 00:19:58,879
We'll start with this, and we'll call you
if we wanna sit down.

230
00:19:59,095 --> 00:20:02,049
- Yes, sir. You have a great day.
- You too.

231
00:20:09,105 --> 00:20:10,729
<i>Hey, yeah, how you doing?</i>

232
00:20:10,940 --> 00:20:13,098
This is Chris Gardner calling
for Dr. Delsey.

233
00:20:13,317 --> 00:20:15,476
Yeah, I'm running a little late
for a sales call.

234
00:20:15,695 --> 00:20:19,194
I was wondering if...
Yeah, Osteo National.

235
00:20:19,448 --> 00:20:21,939
Right. We can still...? Half an hour?

236
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:25,824
Yes. Beautiful. Beautiful.
Thank you, thank you.

237
00:20:35,381 --> 00:20:38,501
Hey! Hey!

238
00:20:39,635 --> 00:20:40,964
Hey!

239
00:20:41,178 --> 00:20:42,554
<i>This part of my life...</i>

240
00:20:42,763 --> 00:20:45,433
- Wait!
- <i>... this part here...</i>

241
00:20:47,018 --> 00:20:48,642
<i>... it's called "Running."</i>

242
00:20:48,853 --> 00:20:50,762
Hey! Hey!

243
00:20:50,980 --> 00:20:52,557
Wait!

244
00:20:53,482 --> 00:20:56,270
Hey! Wait!

245
00:20:56,485 --> 00:20:58,858
<i>That was my stolen machine.</i>

246
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:01,111
<i>Unless she was with</i>
<i>a guy who sold them too.</i>

247
00:21:02,658 --> 00:21:03,903
<i>Which was unlikely...</i>

248
00:21:04,118 --> 00:21:06,787
<i>... because I was the only one</i>
<i>selling them in the Bay Area.</i>

249
00:21:06,996 --> 00:21:09,617
<i>I spent our entire life savings</i>
<i>on these things.</i>

250
00:21:12,043 --> 00:21:15,625
<i>It was such</i>
<i>a revolutionary machine.</i>

251
00:21:16,797 --> 00:21:18,208
- Can you feel it, baby?
- Oh, yeah.

252
00:21:18,424 --> 00:21:19,966
You got me doing all the work.

253
00:21:20,176 --> 00:21:22,667
<i>What I didn't know</i>
<i>is that doctors and hospitals...</i>

254
00:21:22,887 --> 00:21:26,754
<i>... would consider them</i>
<i>unnecessary luxuries.</i>

255
00:21:29,393 --> 00:21:32,809
<i>I even asked the landlord</i>
<i>to take a picture.</i>

256
00:21:34,106 --> 00:21:38,982
<i>So if I lost one, it was like losing</i>
<i>a month's groceries.</i>

257
00:21:41,906 --> 00:21:44,860
Hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

258
00:21:47,745 --> 00:21:50,450
Hey, get back here!

259
00:21:55,044 --> 00:21:57,499
Hey, man, I...

260
00:21:59,382 --> 00:22:01,670
- Who's he?
- He's that guy...

261
00:22:12,186 --> 00:22:16,053
- Did you forget?
- Forget what?

262
00:22:17,024 --> 00:22:19,515
You're not supposed
to have any of those.

263
00:22:19,735 --> 00:22:22,938
- Yeah, I know.
- You have two now.

264
00:22:33,332 --> 00:22:34,874
Hey.

265
00:22:37,795 --> 00:22:39,420
Hey, Mom.

266
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,628
One, two, three!

267
00:22:49,724 --> 00:22:52,843
- That's a basketball!
- Hey, hey. What do you mean?

268
00:22:53,060 --> 00:22:54,768
You don't know that
that's a basketball.

269
00:22:54,979 --> 00:22:58,893
This could be an ant farm. This could
be a microscope or anything.

270
00:22:59,108 --> 00:23:01,564
- No, it's not.
- There, there.

271
00:23:01,986 --> 00:23:05,070
All right, come on.
Open him up. Open him up.

272
00:23:10,911 --> 00:23:15,324
- That paper's a little heavy, huh?
- Yeah, but I got it.

273
00:23:26,552 --> 00:23:29,090
You should've seen me
out there today.

274
00:23:29,305 --> 00:23:31,843
Somebody stole a scanner.
I had to run the old girl down...

275
00:23:32,058 --> 00:23:33,635
Whatever.

276
00:23:35,227 --> 00:23:38,312
- What?
- Whatever, Chris.

277
00:23:38,898 --> 00:23:40,725
What the hell
you got attitude about?

278
00:23:40,941 --> 00:23:43,729
- "Whatever" what?
- Every day's got some damn story.

279
00:23:43,944 --> 00:23:45,273
Hey, Roy. Roy!

280
00:23:45,488 --> 00:23:47,776
Can you beat your little rug
when nobody's out here?

281
00:23:47,990 --> 00:23:49,449
There's dust and shit all over.

282
00:23:49,659 --> 00:23:52,031
- I'm trying to keep a clean house.
- Hey, wait a second.

283
00:23:52,244 --> 00:23:54,996
Look, Linda, relax.

284
00:23:55,206 --> 00:23:58,539
We're gonna come out of this.
Everything is gonna be fine, all right?

285
00:23:59,669 --> 00:24:03,536
You said that before,
when I got pregnant. "It'll be fine."

286
00:24:03,756 --> 00:24:08,751
- So you don't trust me now?
- Whatever. I don't care.

287
00:24:23,943 --> 00:24:26,149
- Taxi!
- Mr. Twistle.

288
00:24:26,362 --> 00:24:29,031
- Yeah, hi.
- Hi. Chris Gardner.

289
00:24:29,240 --> 00:24:31,067
Yeah, hi. Listen.
What can I do for you?

290
00:24:31,283 --> 00:24:34,320
I submitted an application for the
intern programme about a month ago...

291
00:24:34,537 --> 00:24:36,779
...and I would just love
to sit with you briefly...

292
00:24:36,998 --> 00:24:38,955
Listen, I'm going
to Noe Valley, Chris.

293
00:24:39,166 --> 00:24:42,452
- Take care of yourself.
- Mr. Twistle.

294
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,995
Actually, I'm on my way
to Noe Valley also.

295
00:24:45,214 --> 00:24:46,957
How about we share a ride?

296
00:24:48,467 --> 00:24:50,626
- All right, get in.
- All right.

297
00:24:56,726 --> 00:24:59,477
So when I was in the Navy,
I worked for a doctor...

298
00:24:59,687 --> 00:25:02,522
...who loved to play golf,
hours every day...

299
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:07,358
...and I would actually
perform medical procedures...

300
00:25:07,570 --> 00:25:09,112
...when he'd leave me in the office.

301
00:25:09,322 --> 00:25:14,564
So I'm used to being in a position
where I have to make decisions and...

302
00:25:16,078 --> 00:25:18,865
Mr. Twistle, listen.
This is a very important...

303
00:25:19,081 --> 00:25:21,288
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
This thing's impossible.

304
00:25:23,377 --> 00:25:25,500
- I can do it.
- No, you can't. No one can.

305
00:25:25,713 --> 00:25:28,382
- That's bullshit.
- No, I'm pretty sure I can do it.

306
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:32,008
- No, you can't.
- Let me see it.

307
00:25:32,595 --> 00:25:33,793
Give it here.

308
00:25:36,766 --> 00:25:41,060
Oh, yeah. Oh, wow,
you really messed it up.

309
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:42,812
Sorry.

310
00:25:43,356 --> 00:25:49,310
It looks like it works around a swivel,
so the centre pieces never move.

311
00:25:49,528 --> 00:25:52,613
So if it's yellow in the centre,
that's the yellow side.

312
00:25:52,823 --> 00:25:55,314
If it's red in the centre,
that's the red side.

313
00:25:55,534 --> 00:25:59,153
- Okay.
- So... You can slow down.

314
00:25:59,372 --> 00:26:02,408
Listen, we can drive around all day.
I don't believe you can do this.

315
00:26:02,625 --> 00:26:04,333
- Yeah, I can.
- No, you can't.

316
00:26:04,543 --> 00:26:05,706
- Yes, I can.
- No, you can't.

317
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,829
I'm telling you, no one can.

318
00:26:09,757 --> 00:26:11,999
See? That's all I ever do.

319
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:27,186
You almost have this side.

320
00:26:27,817 --> 00:26:29,275
Holy cow.

321
00:26:39,495 --> 00:26:43,279
- You almost had that one.
- I'm gonna get it.

322
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:52,583
Look at that.

323
00:27:15,865 --> 00:27:17,063
You're almost there.

324
00:27:40,806 --> 00:27:44,507
- 1710.
- This is me.

325
00:27:46,646 --> 00:27:48,021
Good job.

326
00:27:49,857 --> 00:27:52,977
- Goodbye.
- Yeah. I'll see you soon.

327
00:27:55,404 --> 00:27:57,112
Where are you going, sir?

328
00:27:57,323 --> 00:28:00,324
Excuse me, sir.
Where are you going, please?

329
00:28:03,621 --> 00:28:05,364
Two... A couple of blocks.

330
00:28:05,581 --> 00:28:08,997
- Just flip around.
- Okay.

331
00:28:50,918 --> 00:28:53,670
Hey! Stop it! Hey!

332
00:28:54,046 --> 00:28:55,588
- Where are you going? Come here!
- No!

333
00:28:55,798 --> 00:28:58,633
- No, no, no!
- You asshole, give me my money!

334
00:28:58,843 --> 00:29:00,171
- Give me my money.
- Please stop.

335
00:29:00,386 --> 00:29:02,379
- Please, please, please!
- Son of a bitch.

336
00:29:02,596 --> 00:29:05,134
Please! He should've paid you!

337
00:29:05,349 --> 00:29:06,891
- Come here!
- I'm sorry.

338
00:29:07,101 --> 00:29:08,761
- I'm so sorry.
- I'll kick your ass!

339
00:29:09,270 --> 00:29:12,437
- I'm sorry!
- Idiot.

340
00:29:23,242 --> 00:29:24,571
I'll get you!

341
00:29:24,785 --> 00:29:28,285
I'm going to kill you!
I'm going to kill you!

342
00:29:43,679 --> 00:29:45,755
Hey!

343
00:29:45,973 --> 00:29:48,844
Stop it, you son of a bitch!

344
00:29:49,143 --> 00:29:51,219
Stop him!

345
00:29:54,649 --> 00:29:57,140
Stop him!

346
00:30:02,406 --> 00:30:04,114
<i>The doors are closing.</i>

347
00:30:04,325 --> 00:30:07,160
<i>Please stand clear of the doors.</i>

348
00:30:15,086 --> 00:30:18,205
No! No! No!

349
00:30:20,883 --> 00:30:22,674
No!

350
00:30:45,866 --> 00:30:48,192
- <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, yeah.

351
00:30:48,411 --> 00:30:50,119
Sorry I couldn't
make it home on time.

352
00:30:50,329 --> 00:30:54,541
- <i>Chris, I missed my shift.</i>
- Yeah, I know. I'm sorry about that.

353
00:30:54,750 --> 00:30:58,036
Look, I'm on my way right now.
Are you all right with Christopher?

354
00:30:58,254 --> 00:31:00,626
<i>I'm leaving. Chris, I'm leaving.</i>

355
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:02,832
- What?
- <i>Did you hear what I said?</i>

356
00:31:03,718 --> 00:31:07,632
I have my things together,
and I'm taking our son...

357
00:31:07,847 --> 00:31:09,389
...and we're gonna leave now.

358
00:31:09,765 --> 00:31:11,141
<i>I'm gonna put the phone down.</i>

359
00:31:11,350 --> 00:31:14,885
- Linda, wait a minute. Hold it, hold...
- <i>I'm going to leave. We are leaving.</i>

360
00:31:20,067 --> 00:31:24,017
<i>It was right then that I started</i>
<i>thinking about Thomas Jefferson...</i>

361
00:31:25,323 --> 00:31:27,778
<i>... the Declaration of Independence...</i>

362
00:31:28,117 --> 00:31:34,072
<i>... and the part about our right to life,</i>
<i>liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</i>

363
00:31:34,290 --> 00:31:36,117
<i>And I remember thinking.</i>

364
00:31:36,334 --> 00:31:40,711
<i>How did he know</i>
<i>to put the "pursuit" part in there?</i>

365
00:31:40,921 --> 00:31:45,583
<i>That maybe happiness is something</i>
<i>that we can only pursue.</i>

366
00:31:45,801 --> 00:31:48,838
<i>And maybe we can actually</i>
<i>never have it...</i>

367
00:31:49,180 --> 00:31:50,840
<i>... no matter what.</i>

368
00:31:51,057 --> 00:31:52,765
<i>How did he know that?</i>

369
00:31:57,980 --> 00:32:00,767
Linda. Linda.

370
00:32:33,724 --> 00:32:35,432
- Hello?
- <i>Chris.</i>

371
00:32:35,643 --> 00:32:38,264
- Who is this?
- <i>Jay Twistle.</i>

372
00:32:39,105 --> 00:32:40,931
- Hey.
- <i>Dean Witter.</i>

373
00:32:41,148 --> 00:32:43,818
Yeah, of course. How are you?

374
00:32:44,026 --> 00:32:46,482
<i>I'm fine. Listen, do you still</i>
<i>wanna come in and talk?</i>

375
00:32:46,696 --> 00:32:47,976
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

376
00:32:48,197 --> 00:32:51,068
<i>I'll tell you what. Come on by</i>
<i>day after tomorrow, in the morning.</i>

377
00:32:51,283 --> 00:32:55,032
<i>We're interviewing for the internships.</i>
<i>You got a pen and paper?</i>

378
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:56,830
Yes. Yes, I do.

379
00:32:59,792 --> 00:33:02,544
- Hold on one second.
- <i>All right.</i>

380
00:33:06,424 --> 00:33:08,547
<i>Hello?</i>

381
00:33:08,759 --> 00:33:11,085
- <i>Chris?</i>
- Go ahead. I have one.

382
00:33:11,304 --> 00:33:13,925
<i>Write this number down so you can</i>
<i>call my secretary, Janice.</i>

383
00:33:14,140 --> 00:33:16,179
- <i>She can give you all the specifics.</i>
- Yep.

384
00:33:16,392 --> 00:33:18,266
- <i>Okay, 415.</i>
- 415.

385
00:33:18,477 --> 00:33:20,185
- <i>864.</i>
- 864.

386
00:33:20,396 --> 00:33:22,389
- <i>0256.</i>
- 0256.

387
00:33:22,606 --> 00:33:25,607
- <i>Yeah, extension 4796.</i>
- 4796.

388
00:33:25,818 --> 00:33:30,065
- <i>Right. Call her tomorrow.</i>
- Yes, sir. 415-864-0256.

389
00:33:30,281 --> 00:33:31,561
- <i>Okay, buddy.</i>
- All right, yes.

390
00:33:31,782 --> 00:33:33,941
- Thank you very much.
- <i>We'll see you soon.</i>

391
00:33:34,744 --> 00:33:37,863
864-0256.

392
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:41,283
4796. Janice.

393
00:33:44,337 --> 00:33:46,163
- Chris.
- Hey.

394
00:33:46,380 --> 00:33:48,622
Did you...? Have you seen
Linda and Christopher?

395
00:33:48,841 --> 00:33:50,715
- No. You catch the game last night?
- No, no.

396
00:33:50,926 --> 00:33:52,302
You didn't see that, 118, 1...?

397
00:33:52,511 --> 00:33:54,718
Excuse me, did Linda
and Christopher come in here?

398
00:33:54,930 --> 00:33:58,549
- No, I haven't seen them.
- 119-120. Double overtime.

399
00:33:58,768 --> 00:34:00,891
Moons hits a three-pointer
at 17 seconds left.

400
00:34:01,103 --> 00:34:02,728
Wayne, Wayne, Wayne.

401
00:34:02,938 --> 00:34:05,061
Can't talk to you
about numbers right now.

402
00:34:05,274 --> 00:34:07,896
- What's your problem with numbers?
- <i>864-2...</i>

403
00:34:08,110 --> 00:34:10,020
- And you owe me money.
- Yeah.

404
00:34:10,237 --> 00:34:11,981
You owe me $14.

405
00:34:12,198 --> 00:34:14,071
I'm gonna get that to you.

406
00:34:14,950 --> 00:34:17,406
I need my money.
I need my money.

407
00:34:18,496 --> 00:34:20,572
Fourteen's a number.

408
00:34:47,024 --> 00:34:50,274
Hey, don't you ever take my son
away from me again.

409
00:34:50,486 --> 00:34:51,766
- You hear me?
- Leave me alone!

410
00:34:51,988 --> 00:34:53,779
Don't take my son away
from me again.

411
00:34:53,990 --> 00:34:55,781
Do you understand
what I'm saying to you?

412
00:34:55,992 --> 00:34:59,277
Don't you walk away from me when
I'm talking to you. Do you hear me?

413
00:34:59,495 --> 00:35:00,989
- Do you wanna leave?
- Yeah.

414
00:35:01,205 --> 00:35:04,040
- You wanna leave?
- Yes, I want to leave!

415
00:35:05,293 --> 00:35:07,119
Get the hell out of here,
then, Linda.

416
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:09,874
Get the hell out of here.
Christopher's staying with me.

417
00:35:10,089 --> 00:35:12,378
You're the one that dragged
us down. You hear me?

418
00:35:12,591 --> 00:35:15,676
- You are so weak.
- No. I am not happy anymore.

419
00:35:15,886 --> 00:35:18,460
- I'm just not happy!
- Then go get happy, Linda!

420
00:35:18,681 --> 00:35:20,056
Just go get happy.

421
00:35:20,599 --> 00:35:22,473
But Christopher's living with me.

422
00:35:22,685 --> 00:35:24,476
- Stop!
- Did you hear what I said?

423
00:35:24,770 --> 00:35:27,142
Christopher's living with me!

424
00:35:53,341 --> 00:35:56,258
Hey. Come on, let's go.

425
00:35:56,469 --> 00:35:58,794
- How you doing, Mrs. Chu?
- Hi.

426
00:36:02,475 --> 00:36:05,013
- Where's Mom?
- Look, just get your stuff.

427
00:36:05,227 --> 00:36:08,679
But she told me she was
coming to pick me up today.

428
00:36:08,898 --> 00:36:10,937
Yeah, I know.

429
00:36:12,068 --> 00:36:16,694
I talked to Mom earlier.
Everything's fine, okay?

430
00:36:22,161 --> 00:36:24,367
Where do I sleep tonight?

431
00:36:24,580 --> 00:36:26,703
Let me ask you something.
Are you happy?

432
00:36:26,916 --> 00:36:29,537
- Yeah.
- All right. Because I'm happy.

433
00:36:29,752 --> 00:36:33,203
And if you're happy and I'm happy,
then that's a good thing, right?

434
00:36:33,422 --> 00:36:34,964
- Yeah.
- All right.

435
00:36:35,174 --> 00:36:37,214
You're sleeping with me.

436
00:36:37,426 --> 00:36:42,053
You're staying at home,
where you belong, all right?

437
00:36:56,529 --> 00:36:58,189
Christopher.

438
00:37:15,756 --> 00:37:18,591
Hey, listen. I need the rent.

439
00:37:18,801 --> 00:37:20,212
I can't wait anymore.

440
00:37:20,428 --> 00:37:22,800
Yeah, I'm good for that, Charlie.
I'm gonna get it.

441
00:37:23,014 --> 00:37:26,050
Why don't you go two blocks over
at the Mission Inn motel?

442
00:37:26,267 --> 00:37:27,809
It's half what you pay here.

443
00:37:28,019 --> 00:37:31,434
Listen, Chris. I need you out
of here in the morning.

444
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:34,938
The hell am I supposed
to be out of here tomorrow?

445
00:37:35,151 --> 00:37:36,349
I got painters coming in.

446
00:37:36,569 --> 00:37:38,858
- All right, look. I need more time.
- No.

447
00:37:39,071 --> 00:37:41,194
All right, I'll paint it myself.

448
00:37:41,407 --> 00:37:46,781
All right, but I just... I gotta have some
more time... I got my son up in here.

449
00:37:51,625 --> 00:37:56,453
All right. One week.
And you paint it.

450
00:38:48,349 --> 00:38:49,973
Chris Gardner?

451
00:38:50,559 --> 00:38:53,264
Yeah. What happened?

452
00:38:53,479 --> 00:38:57,346
- Payable to the City of San Francisco.
- Does it have to be the full amount?

453
00:38:57,566 --> 00:39:01,018
You gotta pay each parking ticket,
otherwise, you're staying.

454
00:39:01,237 --> 00:39:02,696
This is all I got.

455
00:39:08,202 --> 00:39:10,871
We verify at 9:30
tomorrow morning.

456
00:39:11,414 --> 00:39:14,450
- What?
- You gotta stay until this thing clears.

457
00:39:16,627 --> 00:39:18,205
No.

458
00:39:18,421 --> 00:39:20,212
No, I can't spend the night here.

459
00:39:20,423 --> 00:39:22,996
- I have to pick up my son.
- We verify at 9:30 tomorrow.

460
00:39:23,217 --> 00:39:27,844
Sir, I have a job interview at Dean
Witter at 10: 15 tomorrow morning.

461
00:39:28,055 --> 00:39:29,715
- I cannot stay...
- 9:30 tomorrow morning.

462
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:32,257
What am I supposed to do
with my son?

463
00:39:32,476 --> 00:39:34,932
- Is there anyone else who can...?
- I take care of him.

464
00:39:35,146 --> 00:39:38,182
Maybe we can go and have
Social Services pick him up.

465
00:39:42,236 --> 00:39:45,901
All right.
Can I have my phone call, please?

466
00:39:49,118 --> 00:39:51,360
- Hello.
- <i>Hey.</i>

467
00:39:51,579 --> 00:39:53,287
What do you want?

468
00:39:54,457 --> 00:39:59,083
You gotta get Christopher
from daycare. I can't.

469
00:40:00,254 --> 00:40:03,919
Just keep him for the night and I'm...
And... Just one night.

470
00:40:04,133 --> 00:40:06,173
<i>What happened?</i>

471
00:40:06,385 --> 00:40:09,837
I'll pick him up
from daycare tomorrow.

472
00:40:10,056 --> 00:40:11,799
I'm gonna go right...
You can just...

473
00:40:12,016 --> 00:40:14,305
You can drop him off
and I'll pick him up.

474
00:40:14,644 --> 00:40:18,095
- No.
- <i>Come on, Linda.</i>

475
00:40:18,314 --> 00:40:22,561
- <i>Why you doing that?</i>
- No, I wanna take him to the park.

476
00:40:22,985 --> 00:40:27,113
To Golden Gate
after daycare tomorrow.

477
00:40:28,366 --> 00:40:30,489
- How is he?
- He's fine.

478
00:40:30,701 --> 00:40:33,786
All right, just... All right,
take him to the park...

479
00:40:33,996 --> 00:40:37,780
...and bring him back, all right?

480
00:40:38,000 --> 00:40:40,954
All right, just bring me my son back.

481
00:40:41,921 --> 00:40:43,795
<i>Okay?</i>

482
00:40:44,006 --> 00:40:45,548
<i>Linda?</i>

483
00:40:45,758 --> 00:40:47,632
I'll bring him back around 6.

484
00:40:49,512 --> 00:40:51,670
All right, all right.

485
00:40:51,889 --> 00:40:53,763
Thank you.

486
00:40:56,185 --> 00:40:57,679
Bye.

487
00:41:22,503 --> 00:41:24,211
I'm okay?

488
00:41:59,165 --> 00:42:01,288
Excuse me. Excuse me.

489
00:42:01,834 --> 00:42:03,293
Yes, I did.

490
00:42:11,927 --> 00:42:13,719
Mr. Gardner.

491
00:42:20,811 --> 00:42:22,721
This way.

492
00:42:24,940 --> 00:42:26,980
It'll be right over there.

493
00:42:39,080 --> 00:42:40,455
What is the one like that one?

494
00:43:02,144 --> 00:43:04,018
Chris Gardner.

495
00:43:06,607 --> 00:43:08,267
Chris Gardner.

496
00:43:08,693 --> 00:43:10,685
How are you? Good morning.

497
00:43:11,278 --> 00:43:15,146
Chris Gardner. Chris Gardner.
Good to see you again.

498
00:43:15,366 --> 00:43:17,323
Chris Gardner. Pleasure.

499
00:43:18,995 --> 00:43:21,071
I've been sitting there
for the last half-hour...

500
00:43:21,288 --> 00:43:22,831
...trying to come up with a story...

501
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,287
...that would explain my being here
dressed like this.

502
00:43:27,503 --> 00:43:31,548
And I wanted to come up with a story
that would demonstrate qualities...

503
00:43:31,757 --> 00:43:36,585
...that I'm sure you all admire here,
like earnestness or diligence.

504
00:43:36,804 --> 00:43:41,466
Team-playing, something.
And I couldn't think of anything.

505
00:43:42,685 --> 00:43:44,428
So the truth is...

506
00:43:44,645 --> 00:43:47,267
...I was arrested
for failure to pay parking tickets.

507
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:49,308
Parking tickets?

508
00:43:49,859 --> 00:43:53,394
And I ran all the way here from
the Polk Station, the police station.

509
00:43:53,612 --> 00:43:55,605
What were you doing
before you were arrested?

510
00:43:55,823 --> 00:43:58,824
I was painting my apartment.

511
00:43:59,035 --> 00:44:01,193
Is it dry now?

512
00:44:01,954 --> 00:44:03,152
I hope so.

513
00:44:03,372 --> 00:44:05,080
Jay says you're pretty determined.

514
00:44:05,291 --> 00:44:07,663
He's been waiting outside
the front of the building...

515
00:44:07,877 --> 00:44:10,000
...with some 40-pound gizmo
for over a month.

516
00:44:10,212 --> 00:44:13,581
- He said you're smart.
- Well, I like to think so.

517
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:16,800
- And you want to learn this business?
- Yes, sir, I wanna learn.

518
00:44:17,011 --> 00:44:19,004
Have you already started learning
on your own?

519
00:44:19,221 --> 00:44:20,881
Absolutely.

520
00:44:21,641 --> 00:44:23,432
- Jay?
- Yes, sir.

521
00:44:23,643 --> 00:44:25,719
How many times
have you seen Chris?

522
00:44:25,936 --> 00:44:28,606
I don't know.
One too many, apparently.

523
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:31,557
- Was he ever dressed like this?
- No.

524
00:44:31,776 --> 00:44:33,982
No. Jacket and tie.

525
00:44:35,905 --> 00:44:38,775
First in your class in school?

526
00:44:38,991 --> 00:44:40,818
- High school?
- Yes, sir.

527
00:44:41,243 --> 00:44:44,244
- How many in the class?
- Twelve.

528
00:44:44,455 --> 00:44:46,198
It was a small town.

529
00:44:46,624 --> 00:44:49,993
- I'll say.
- But I was also first in my radar class...

530
00:44:50,211 --> 00:44:53,461
...in the Navy,
and that was a class of 20.

531
00:44:55,925 --> 00:44:57,752
Can I say something?

532
00:44:58,928 --> 00:45:00,636
I'm the type of person...

533
00:45:00,846 --> 00:45:04,097
...if you ask me a question,
and I don't know the answer...

534
00:45:04,308 --> 00:45:06,550
...I'm gonna tell you
that I don't know.

535
00:45:06,769 --> 00:45:08,097
But I bet you what.

536
00:45:08,312 --> 00:45:13,307
I know how to find the answer,
and I will find the answer.

537
00:45:14,527 --> 00:45:16,235
Is that fair enough?

538
00:45:17,488 --> 00:45:18,686
Chris.

539
00:45:20,032 --> 00:45:23,733
What would you say
if a guy walked in for an interview...

540
00:45:23,953 --> 00:45:25,945
...without a shirt on...

541
00:45:26,163 --> 00:45:29,081
...and I hired him?
What would you say?

542
00:45:33,337 --> 00:45:36,422
He must've had on
some really nice pants.

543
00:45:51,147 --> 00:45:54,681
Chris, I don't know how you did it
dressed as a garbage man...

544
00:45:54,900 --> 00:45:57,142
...but you pulled it off.
- Thank you, Mr. Twistle.

545
00:45:57,361 --> 00:45:59,769
Hey, now you can call me Jay.
We'll talk to you soon.

546
00:46:00,364 --> 00:46:02,902
All right, so I'll let you know, Jay.

547
00:46:03,701 --> 00:46:05,990
"You'll let me know, Jay"?
What do you mean?

548
00:46:06,203 --> 00:46:08,161
Yeah, I'll give you a call
tomorrow sometime...

549
00:46:08,372 --> 00:46:10,495
What are you talking...?
You hounded me for this.

550
00:46:10,708 --> 00:46:13,460
- You stood here...
- Listen, there's no salary.

551
00:46:13,669 --> 00:46:15,045
- No.
- I was not aware of that.

552
00:46:15,254 --> 00:46:16,832
My circumstances
have changed some...

553
00:46:17,381 --> 00:46:21,082
...and I need to be certain that I'll be...
- All right. Okay.

554
00:46:24,221 --> 00:46:25,799
Tonight.

555
00:46:26,015 --> 00:46:29,514
I swear I will fill your spot. I promise.

556
00:46:29,727 --> 00:46:32,728
If you back out, you know what
I'll look like to the partners?

557
00:46:32,938 --> 00:46:35,892
Yes, an ass... A-hole.

558
00:46:36,192 --> 00:46:39,608
Yeah, an ass A-hole, all the way.

559
00:46:42,490 --> 00:46:45,063
You are a piece of work.

560
00:46:46,118 --> 00:46:47,660
Tonight.

561
00:46:55,962 --> 00:46:57,919
<i>There was no salary.</i>

562
00:46:58,130 --> 00:47:01,297
<i>Not even a reasonable promise</i>
<i>of a job.</i>

563
00:47:07,974 --> 00:47:12,600
<i>One intern was hired at the end</i>
<i>of the programme from a pool of 20.</i>

564
00:47:12,937 --> 00:47:14,217
<i>And if you weren't that guy...</i>

565
00:47:14,438 --> 00:47:16,810
<i>... you couldn't even apply</i>
<i>the six months' training...</i>

566
00:47:17,024 --> 00:47:18,851
<i>... to another brokerage.</i>

567
00:47:21,404 --> 00:47:23,527
<i>The only resource I would have</i>
<i>for six months...</i>

568
00:47:23,739 --> 00:47:27,654
<i>... would be my six scanners,</i>
<i>which I could still try to sell.</i>

569
00:47:28,869 --> 00:47:32,321
<i>If I sold them all,</i>
<i>maybe we might get by.</i>

570
00:48:19,211 --> 00:48:22,415
- I got him. I got him.
- He's asleep.

571
00:48:22,632 --> 00:48:24,174
All right.

572
00:48:30,556 --> 00:48:32,430
Okay, baby.

573
00:48:44,987 --> 00:48:46,779
I got it.

574
00:48:51,744 --> 00:48:53,783
I'm going to New York.

575
00:49:23,234 --> 00:49:25,559
My sister's boyfriend...

576
00:49:26,153 --> 00:49:29,653
...opened a restaurant,
and they may have a job for me there.

577
00:49:30,408 --> 00:49:32,899
So I'm going to New York, Chris.

578
00:49:35,871 --> 00:49:37,781
Christopher's staying with me.

579
00:49:44,714 --> 00:49:47,549
I'm his mom, you know?

580
00:49:47,758 --> 00:49:49,834
He should be with his mom.

581
00:49:50,052 --> 00:49:51,926
I should have him, right?

582
00:49:52,805 --> 00:49:55,177
You know
you can't take care of him.

583
00:50:03,065 --> 00:50:04,607
What are you gonna do for money?

584
00:50:06,861 --> 00:50:12,365
I had an interview
at Dean Witter for an internship...

585
00:50:12,575 --> 00:50:14,034
...and I got it.

586
00:50:14,243 --> 00:50:16,781
So I'm gonna stand out
in my programme.

587
00:50:18,497 --> 00:50:20,573
Salesman to intern's backwards.

588
00:50:20,791 --> 00:50:22,701
No, it's not.

589
00:50:24,879 --> 00:50:26,539
I gotta go.

590
00:51:00,122 --> 00:51:02,494
Tell him I love him, okay?

591
00:51:03,125 --> 00:51:04,750
<i>And...</i>

592
00:51:10,675 --> 00:51:13,000
I know you'll take care of him, Chris.

593
00:51:13,219 --> 00:51:14,927
I know that.

594
00:51:56,512 --> 00:51:59,264
- <i>Dean Witter.</i>
- Yes, hi.

595
00:51:59,557 --> 00:52:03,305
Yes, I'd like to leave a message
for Mr. Jay Twistle.

596
00:52:03,519 --> 00:52:07,054
- <i>Your name?</i>
- Yeah, my name is Chris Gardner.

597
00:52:07,273 --> 00:52:08,387
The message is:

598
00:52:08,607 --> 00:52:14,278
Thank you very much
for inviting me into the programme.

599
00:52:14,488 --> 00:52:20,324
I really appreciate it and I'd be
very pleased to accept your invitation.

600
00:52:20,536 --> 00:52:22,410
<i>Is that all?</i>

601
00:52:22,705 --> 00:52:24,247
Yes, that's it.

602
00:52:24,457 --> 00:52:26,200
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Thank you.

603
00:52:26,417 --> 00:52:27,995
<i>Bye.</i>

604
00:52:54,570 --> 00:52:55,851
- Be careful with that.
- What?

605
00:52:56,072 --> 00:52:58,859
Be care... Go ahead.

606
00:53:22,723 --> 00:53:25,641
- Are we there?
- Yep.

607
00:53:38,948 --> 00:53:41,486
- Hey, you know what today is?
- Yeah.

608
00:53:41,701 --> 00:53:43,361
- What?
- Saturday.

609
00:53:43,577 --> 00:53:45,866
- You know what Saturday is, right?
- Yeah.

610
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:48,488
- What?
- Basketball.

611
00:53:48,708 --> 00:53:51,578
- You wanna go play some basketball?
- Okay.

612
00:53:51,794 --> 00:53:54,367
All right, then we're gonna go
sell a bone-density scanner.

613
00:53:54,588 --> 00:53:58,835
- How about that? Wanna do that?
- No.

614
00:54:00,052 --> 00:54:02,424
Hey, Dad. I'm going pro.

615
00:54:04,140 --> 00:54:06,097
I'm going pro.

616
00:54:07,393 --> 00:54:08,768
Okay.

617
00:54:08,978 --> 00:54:11,765
Yeah, I don't know, you know.

618
00:54:12,481 --> 00:54:14,723
You'll probably be about as good
as I was.

619
00:54:14,942 --> 00:54:18,026
That's kind of the way it works,
you know. I was below average.

620
00:54:18,404 --> 00:54:22,022
You know, so you'll probably
ultimately rank...

621
00:54:22,241 --> 00:54:24,862
...somewhere around there,
you know, so...

622
00:54:25,077 --> 00:54:27,948
...I really... You'll excel at
a lot of things, just not this.

623
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,571
I don't want you shooting
this ball all day and night.

624
00:54:30,791 --> 00:54:32,286
- All right?
- All right.

625
00:54:32,501 --> 00:54:34,328
Okay.

626
00:54:35,504 --> 00:54:37,129
All right, go ahead.

627
00:55:00,946 --> 00:55:02,571
Hey.

628
00:55:05,743 --> 00:55:08,068
Don't ever let somebody tell you...

629
00:55:08,287 --> 00:55:10,825
...you can't do something.

630
00:55:11,540 --> 00:55:13,663
Not even me.

631
00:55:15,002 --> 00:55:18,169
- All right?
- All right.

632
00:55:18,881 --> 00:55:21,039
You got a dream...

633
00:55:21,258 --> 00:55:23,500
...you gotta protect it.

634
00:55:24,595 --> 00:55:26,255
People can't do something
themselves...

635
00:55:26,472 --> 00:55:28,880
...they wanna tell you
you can't do it.

636
00:55:33,229 --> 00:55:37,013
If you want something,
go get it. Period.

637
00:55:45,074 --> 00:55:46,652
Let's go.

638
00:55:49,745 --> 00:55:52,283
Dad, why did we move to a motel?

639
00:55:52,498 --> 00:55:54,954
I told you. Because I'm getting
a better job.

640
00:55:56,252 --> 00:55:59,253
- You gotta trust me, all right?
- I trust you.

641
00:55:59,463 --> 00:56:02,215
All right, here.
Come on, come on. Keep up.

642
00:56:03,426 --> 00:56:06,380
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

643
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:09,136
Dad, when's Mom coming back?

644
00:56:09,348 --> 00:56:11,555
I don't know, Christopher.

645
00:56:11,934 --> 00:56:13,843
Dad, listen to this.

646
00:56:14,061 --> 00:56:17,513
One day, a man was <i>drownding</i>
in the water.

647
00:56:17,732 --> 00:56:20,187
And a boat came by and said,
"Do you need any help?"

648
00:56:20,401 --> 00:56:22,726
He said, " No, thank you.
God will save me."

649
00:56:22,945 --> 00:56:26,112
Then another boat came by.
Said, "Do you need any help?"

650
00:56:26,324 --> 00:56:28,696
And he said, " No, thank you.
God will save me."

651
00:56:28,909 --> 00:56:31,032
Then he drowned,
and he went to heaven.

652
00:56:31,245 --> 00:56:34,448
And he said, " God,
why didn't you save me?"

653
00:56:34,665 --> 00:56:38,165
And God said, " I sent you
two big boats, you dummy."

654
00:56:39,462 --> 00:56:40,920
Do you like it?

655
00:56:41,130 --> 00:56:43,835
Yeah, that's very funny, man.
Give me your hand.

656
00:56:49,847 --> 00:56:51,507
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Yes, sir.

657
00:56:51,724 --> 00:56:53,348
- You got the bill of sale here.
- Yes.

658
00:56:53,559 --> 00:56:54,934
All the information you'll need.

659
00:56:55,144 --> 00:56:56,769
Thank you very much
for your business.

660
00:56:56,979 --> 00:56:58,473
Thank you.

661
00:57:01,192 --> 00:57:03,943
One hundred, 200,
20, 40, 45, 46...

662
00:57:04,153 --> 00:57:05,778
...7, 8, 9, 10.

663
00:57:06,364 --> 00:57:07,443
Thank you.

664
00:57:09,825 --> 00:57:12,743
- Hey, you want one of those?
- No, it's okay.

665
00:57:12,953 --> 00:57:15,242
Come on, you can have one.
Which one?

666
00:57:16,165 --> 00:57:19,664
- You like that one? How much?
- Twenty-five cents.

667
00:57:33,891 --> 00:57:37,592
<i>This part of my life</i>
<i>is called "Internship."</i>

668
00:57:37,812 --> 00:57:41,145
The 1200 building is
Medley Industrial and Sanko Oil.

669
00:57:41,357 --> 00:57:43,646
The building across the street
is Lee-Ray Shipping.

670
00:57:43,859 --> 00:57:45,733
In a couple weeks,
you'll get call sheets...

671
00:57:45,945 --> 00:57:47,772
...with the phone numbers
of employees...

672
00:57:47,989 --> 00:57:51,108
...from every <i>Fortune 500</i> company
in the financial district.

673
00:57:51,409 --> 00:57:54,113
You will be pooling
from 60 <i>Fortune</i> companies.

674
00:57:54,328 --> 00:57:57,080
You will mainly be cold-calling
potential clients.

675
00:57:57,289 --> 00:58:00,290
But if you have to have lunch
with them, have breakfast with them...

676
00:58:00,501 --> 00:58:03,751
...even baby-sit for them, do whatever
it takes to familiarize them...

677
00:58:03,963 --> 00:58:06,880
...with our packages. We need you
to match their needs and goals...

678
00:58:07,091 --> 00:58:12,002
...to one of our many financial plans.
In essence, you reel them in...

679
00:58:12,221 --> 00:58:14,344
...we'll cook the fish.

680
00:58:15,141 --> 00:58:17,180
Some of you are here
because you know somebody.

681
00:58:17,393 --> 00:58:19,765
Some of you are here because
you think you're somebody.

682
00:58:20,062 --> 00:58:22,518
There's one guy in here
who's gonna be somebody.

683
00:58:22,732 --> 00:58:24,938
That person's gonna be the guy...

684
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:27,393
...who can turn this into this.

685
00:58:27,611 --> 00:58:30,696
Eight hundred thousand
in commission dollars.

686
00:58:31,240 --> 00:58:33,031
You, you, help me hand these out.

687
00:58:33,909 --> 00:58:36,946
This is going to be your bible.

688
00:58:37,163 --> 00:58:38,491
You'll eat with it.

689
00:58:38,706 --> 00:58:40,366
- You'll drink with it.
- <i>It was simple.</i>

690
00:58:40,583 --> 00:58:43,537
<i>X number of calls</i>
<i>equals X number of prospects.</i>

691
00:58:43,753 --> 00:58:46,707
<i>X number of prospects</i>
<i>equals X number of customers.</i>

692
00:58:47,006 --> 00:58:50,090
<i>X number of customers</i>
<i>equals X number of dollars...</i>

693
00:58:50,301 --> 00:58:52,459
- <i>... in the company's pocket.</i>
- Your board exam.

694
00:58:52,678 --> 00:58:58,551
Last year, we had an intern score
a 96.4 percent on the written exam.

695
00:58:58,768 --> 00:59:02,101
He wasn't chosen.
It's not a simple pass-fail.

696
00:59:02,313 --> 00:59:05,729
It's an evaluation tool we use
to separate applicants.

697
00:59:05,941 --> 00:59:08,267
Be safe, score a hundred.

698
00:59:09,278 --> 00:59:12,398
Okay, let's take a break.
Be back in 10.

699
00:59:21,707 --> 00:59:24,625
- Hey, Mr. Frohm. Chris.
- Hi.

700
00:59:24,835 --> 00:59:27,042
- Chris, how are you?
- I'm good. How you doing?

701
00:59:27,254 --> 00:59:31,335
- Fine, thank you for asking.
- First day in there. It was exciting.

702
00:59:31,550 --> 00:59:33,626
You're not quitting on us yet,
are you?

703
00:59:33,844 --> 00:59:35,671
No, sir. Ten-minute break.

704
00:59:35,888 --> 00:59:38,675
Pop out, get a quick bite and then
back in there for board prep.

705
00:59:38,891 --> 00:59:40,599
Oh, man, I remember mine.

706
00:59:40,810 --> 00:59:43,301
And ours were only an hour,
not three like yours.

707
00:59:43,521 --> 00:59:45,928
We didn't do world markets,
didn't bother with taxes...

708
00:59:46,148 --> 00:59:49,517
...and it was still a pain in the ass.
Funny what you remember.

709
00:59:49,735 --> 00:59:51,894
There was a beautiful girl
in that class.

710
00:59:52,113 --> 00:59:54,438
I can't remember her name,
but her face was so...

711
00:59:54,657 --> 00:59:56,982
I've seen an old friend of mine.
Do you mind?

712
00:59:57,201 --> 00:59:59,988
- No, go ahead.
- Good talking to you, sir.

713
01:00:29,525 --> 01:00:33,439
Hey, asshole.
Are you all right, asshole?

714
01:00:33,738 --> 01:00:36,608
Are you okay?
What were you thinking?

715
01:00:36,824 --> 01:00:38,982
What are you doing?
I could've killed you.

716
01:00:39,201 --> 01:00:41,490
I'm trying to cross the street.

717
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:45,155
- Well, you're all right?
- Yeah, yeah.

718
01:00:45,499 --> 01:00:47,042
- Where's my shoe?
- What?

719
01:00:47,251 --> 01:00:51,035
- You knocked off my shoe!
- I don't know where your shoe is.

720
01:00:52,506 --> 01:00:55,377
- Where's my damn shoe?
- I don't know.

721
01:01:01,223 --> 01:01:02,682
Hey.

722
01:01:03,559 --> 01:01:06,845
- Did you see it? I lost my shoe.
- No, I'm sorry.

723
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:10,396
Hey. Hey, where are you going?

724
01:01:10,608 --> 01:01:13,525
- We should wait for the police.
- I gotta go to work.

725
01:01:14,236 --> 01:01:17,937
Hey, you just got hit by a car.
Go to the hospital.

726
01:01:18,282 --> 01:01:21,817
I'm in a competitive internship
at Dean Witter.

727
01:01:32,421 --> 01:01:34,046
Hey, man, you're missing a shoe.

728
01:01:34,256 --> 01:01:38,337
Oh, yeah, thanks. Thank you.

729
01:01:44,183 --> 01:01:45,558
Dad.

730
01:01:46,102 --> 01:01:49,103
- You don't have a shoe.
- Yeah, I know.

731
01:01:49,313 --> 01:01:52,398
- Wanna know what happened?
- Yeah.

732
01:01:53,109 --> 01:01:54,603
I got hit by a car.

733
01:01:54,819 --> 01:01:57,488
- You got hit by a car?
- Yep.

734
01:01:57,697 --> 01:02:01,315
- Where?
- Just right by the office.

735
01:02:01,534 --> 01:02:04,570
- No, where in your body?
- Like, the back of my legs.

736
01:02:04,787 --> 01:02:06,614
- Hey, goodbye, Mrs. Chu.
- Goodbye.

737
01:02:06,831 --> 01:02:09,997
- Were you on the street?
- Yeah, I was running in the street.

738
01:02:10,209 --> 01:02:13,080
Don't do that. You can get hurt.

739
01:02:13,462 --> 01:02:15,289
Yeah, thanks.

740
01:02:15,506 --> 01:02:17,249
I'll remember that next time.

741
01:02:19,552 --> 01:02:20,927
<i>And here I was again.</i>

742
01:02:21,137 --> 01:02:23,758
- <i>Show up early.</i>
- While qualified persons...

743
01:02:24,015 --> 01:02:27,882
...qualified persons are interested in
investing and have money to invest.

744
01:02:28,102 --> 01:02:29,976
- Now, Chris.
- Yes, sir.

745
01:02:30,187 --> 01:02:32,227
Would you get me
some coffee, please?

746
01:02:32,440 --> 01:02:36,307
<i>Favours for Frakesh,</i>
<i>our office manager. All day.</i>

747
01:02:36,527 --> 01:02:39,100
My name is Chris Gardner
calling for Mr. Michael Anderson.

748
01:02:39,322 --> 01:02:41,729
Yes, sir, we're having a lunch
actually this Thursday.

749
01:02:41,949 --> 01:02:44,820
Okay, next time.
All right, I'm gonna hold you to that.

750
01:02:45,036 --> 01:02:46,364
Okay, yes, thank you.

751
01:02:46,579 --> 01:02:47,954
Who wants to get me a doughnut?

752
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:51,864
- Chris?
- Yes, sir.

753
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:56,419
<i>Feeling underrated</i>
<i>and unappreciated.</i>

754
01:02:56,714 --> 01:02:58,256
Hello, Mr. Ronald Fryer.

755
01:02:58,466 --> 01:03:00,754
Good morning to you, sir.
My name is Chris Gardner.

756
01:03:00,968 --> 01:03:02,297
I'm calling from Dean Witter.

757
01:03:02,511 --> 01:03:05,715
Yes, I have some very, very valuable
information on what's called a tax...

758
01:03:05,931 --> 01:03:08,173
Okay, thank you, sir.

759
01:03:09,310 --> 01:03:13,972
<i>Then catch the bus by 4 to the place</i>

761
01:03:16,567 --> 01:03:18,311
<i>The 22 home.</i>

762
01:03:19,612 --> 01:03:22,233
- Hey, Chris!
- Hey. Hi, Ralph.

763
01:03:22,448 --> 01:03:25,319
- I'm waiting.
- All right, I got that for you, Ralph.

764
01:03:25,534 --> 01:03:27,610
I'm gonna get that for you.

765
01:03:35,795 --> 01:03:39,211
<i>Whoever brought in the most money</i>
<i>after six months was usually hired.</i>

766
01:03:39,423 --> 01:03:41,499
Hello, Chris Gardner calling
for Mr. Walter Hobb.

767
01:03:41,717 --> 01:03:44,802
<i>We were all working our way</i>
<i>up call sheets to sign clients.</i>

768
01:03:45,012 --> 01:03:47,301
- <i>From the bottom to the top.</i>
- Yes, sir.

769
01:03:47,515 --> 01:03:50,184
- <i>From the doorman to the CEO.</i>
- Okay.

770
01:03:50,977 --> 01:03:53,598
<i>They'd stay till 7,</i>
<i>but I had Christopher.</i>

771
01:03:53,813 --> 01:03:56,849
<i>I had to do in six hours</i>
<i>what they do in nine.</i>

772

Good afternoon, my name is Chris
Gardner. I'm calling from Dean Witter.

773
01:04:00,403 --> 01:04:01,980
<i>In order not to waste any time...</i>

774

<i>... I wasn't hanging up the phone</i>
<i>in between calls.</i>

775
01:04:04,573 --> 01:04:06,649
Okay, thank you very much.

776
01:04:08,244 --> 01:04:10,402
<i>I realized that</i>
<i>by not hanging up the phone...</i>

777
01:04:10,621 --> 01:04:12,578
<i>... I gained another eight minutes</i>
<i>a day.</i>

778
01:04:12,790 --> 01:04:15,032
Why, good morning to you,
my name is Chris Gardner.

779
01:04:15,251 --> 01:04:17,742
- I'm calling from Dean Witter.
- <i>I wasn't drinking water...</i>

780
01:04:17,962 --> 01:04:20,001
<i>... so I didn't waste any time</i>
<i>in the bathroom.</i>

781
01:04:20,214 --> 01:04:22,372
Yes, I'd love to have
the opportunity...

782
01:04:22,591 --> 01:04:25,676
Okay, no problem at all, sir.
Thank you very much.

783
01:04:25,886 --> 01:04:27,215
<i>But even doing all this...</i>

784
01:04:27,430 --> 01:04:31,510
<i>... after two months, I still didn't have</i>
<i>time to work my way up a sheet.</i>

785
01:04:44,739 --> 01:04:47,230
We're feeling really confident
about that one as well.

<i>Can you be here in 20 minutes?</i>

797
01:05:15,186 --> 01:05:18,103
- Twenty minutes. Absolutely.

- Hey, Mr. Frakesh.

803

Hey, do you have five minutes?

804
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:36,157
I got a green light
from Walter Ribbon...

805
01:05:36,374 --> 01:05:39,458
I'm supposed to present commodities
to Bromer. Could you move my car?

806
01:05:39,669 --> 01:05:42,919
That'd really help me out. It's on
Samson, half block, silver Caprice.

807
01:05:43,130 --> 01:05:46,297
Just move it to the other side. They're
street sweeping. There's spaces.

808
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:49,082
Hang on to these.
I have backups in my desk.

809
01:05:49,303 --> 01:05:50,797
And you have to jimmy that.

810
01:05:51,013 --> 01:05:52,970
- Jimmy what?
- You have to jimmy the key.

811
01:05:53,182 --> 01:05:57,844
And the other doors don't unlock.
You have to jimmy it.

812
01:06:14,036 --> 01:06:15,780
Come on, I'm jimmying it.

813
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:20,452
Oh, no!

814
01:06:21,794 --> 01:06:23,205
Come on.

815
01:06:36,267 --> 01:06:38,306
- Here's the file, Mr. Ribbon.
- Thank you.

816
01:06:43,232 --> 01:06:46,019
- Thanks a lot.
- Oh, yeah, thanks. Great idea.

817
01:06:50,323 --> 01:06:53,277

01:08:02,812 --> 01:08:04,354
Thank you.

823
01:08:28,462 --> 01:08:32,330
- What's that?
- Just filling out a cheque...

824
01:08:32,550 --> 01:08:35,041
...paying some bills...

825
01:08:35,261 --> 01:08:37,300
...and a parking ticket.

826
01:08:39,181 --> 01:08:41,221
We don't have a car anymore.

827
01:08:41,434 --> 01:08:43,640
Yep, I know.

828
01:08:47,189 --> 01:08:50,226
I'm gonna need to take you
with me this weekend.

829
01:08:50,443 --> 01:08:52,684
A couple of doctors' offices.

830
01:08:53,154 --> 01:08:56,986
- On sales calls, okay?
- Okay.

831
01:08:59,910 --> 01:09:03,908
Then, possibly,
we'll go to the football game.

832
01:09:04,123 --> 01:09:06,958
- Really?
- Possibly.

833
01:09:07,376 --> 01:09:09,832
- All right?
- All right.

834
01:09:10,046 --> 01:09:12,122
Come on, finish up.

835
01:09:12,632 --> 01:09:15,586
- Are you sure?
- Possibly.

836
01:09:16,802 --> 01:09:18,380
Really?

837
01:09:48,334 --> 01:09:52,877
- Are you bringing it to the game?
- Yeah, I don't wanna leave it.

838
01:09:53,089 --> 01:09:56,043
And maybe
we're going to the game.

839
01:09:57,551 --> 01:10:01,501
- Where are we going now?
- To see someone about my job.

840
01:10:01,889 --> 01:10:03,549
I don't understand.

841
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:06,969
- You don't understand what?
- Are we going to the game?

842
01:10:07,186 --> 01:10:09,724
I said possibly
we're going to the game.

843
01:10:09,939 --> 01:10:12,264
- You know what "possibly" means?
- Like probably.

844
01:10:12,483 --> 01:10:15,104
No, "probably" means there's
a good chance that we're going.

845
01:10:15,319 --> 01:10:18,071
"Possibly" means we might,
we might not.

846
01:10:18,280 --> 01:10:21,317
- What does "probably" mean?
- It means we have a good chance.

847
01:10:21,534 --> 01:10:22,909
And what does "possibly" mean?

848
01:10:23,119 --> 01:10:25,574
- I know what it means.
- What does it mean?

849
01:10:25,788 --> 01:10:28,326
It means that we're not going
to the game.

850
01:10:30,001 --> 01:10:33,251
- How did you get so smart?
- Because you're smart.

851
01:10:38,342 --> 01:10:41,094
- Are we there?
- Yeah.

852
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:48,184
- Mr. Ribbon.
- Yes?

853
01:10:48,394 --> 01:10:51,265
How are you, sir?
Chris Gardner. Dean Witter.

854
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:54,270
- Oh, hi. Hi.
- This is my son, Christopher.

855
01:10:54,483 --> 01:10:55,978
- Hi.
- Hey, Christopher.

856
01:10:56,193 --> 01:10:58,601
- What are you doing up here?
- I came to apologise...

857
01:10:58,821 --> 01:11:01,442
...for missing our appointment.
- You didn't need to come up.

858
01:11:01,657 --> 01:11:04,279
We were in the neighbourhood
visiting a very close friend...

859
01:11:04,493 --> 01:11:07,993
...and I wanted to take this opportunity
to say thank you for your time.

860
01:11:08,205 --> 01:11:11,041
- I know you probably waited for me.
- Little bit.

861
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:13,788
I want you to know
that I do not take that for granted.

862
01:11:14,003 --> 01:11:16,042
Oh, come on. What's that?

863
01:11:16,255 --> 01:11:19,706
Oh, it's an Osteo National
bone-density scanner.

864
01:11:20,551 --> 01:11:23,469
A company I bought into
prior to going to work at Witter.

865
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,301
- I have a meeting after the game.
- You're going to the game?

866
01:11:26,515 --> 01:11:28,307
- Yeah.
- Possibly.

867
01:11:29,352 --> 01:11:30,680
- Possibly.
- We're going too.

868
01:11:30,895 --> 01:11:32,555
I'm taking my son, Tim.
My 12-year-old.

869
01:11:32,772 --> 01:11:33,886
We were just leaving. Tim!

870
01:11:34,190 --> 01:11:36,099
Listen, we'll get out of your way.

871
01:11:36,317 --> 01:11:39,022
Again, thank you very much,
and I'm sorry about the other day.

872
01:11:39,236 --> 01:11:41,312
And I hope that
we can reschedule for later.

873
01:11:41,530 --> 01:11:43,025
- You got it.
- Thank you very much.

874
01:11:43,240 --> 01:11:44,900
You take care. Here, come on.

875
01:11:45,117 --> 01:11:46,446
- Say bye-bye, Chris.
- Bye.

876
01:11:46,661 --> 01:11:48,285
Bye, Christopher.

877
01:11:48,496 --> 01:11:49,990
Hey, you guys wanna
come with us?

878
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:53,160
- What...? To Candlestick?
- We're going now. Come with us.

879
01:11:53,376 --> 01:11:56,495
- Where are your seats?
- We've... We're upper deck.

880
01:11:56,712 --> 01:11:57,957
We got a box. Come on.

881
01:11:58,172 --> 01:12:00,330
- You wanna sit in the box?
- No.

882
01:12:01,509 --> 01:12:05,458
It's not actually a box.
It's, you know, a private section.

883
01:12:05,680 --> 01:12:08,135
It's more comfortable.
You wanna go?

884
01:12:08,808 --> 01:12:12,508
- Okay.
- Okay, kids in the back.

885
01:12:13,145 --> 01:12:15,352
Hey, why don't you just put that
in your car?

886
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:21,021
- Yeah, okay. Sure, sure.
- We don't have a car.

887
01:12:21,904 --> 01:12:24,110
- Oh, my...
- What happened?

888
01:12:24,323 --> 01:12:25,699
I think I got stung by a bee.

889
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:28,826
- You all right?
- Oh, yeah. Goodness. I'm fine.

890
01:12:29,036 --> 01:12:31,610
- You're not allergic or anything?
- No, no, no.

891
01:12:31,831 --> 01:12:35,164
- Where'd he get you?
- Just right at the back of my head.

892
01:12:35,376 --> 01:12:37,784
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine, Christopher.

893
01:12:38,004 --> 01:12:40,127
- Does it hurt?
- Christopher, I'm fine.

894
01:12:40,339 --> 01:12:44,207
- Let me see.
- Christopher, sit back. Sit back.

895
01:12:44,427 --> 01:12:46,752
<i>Thomas Jefferson mentions</i>
<i>happiness a couple times...</i>

896
01:12:46,971 --> 01:12:49,758
<i>... in the Declaration</i>
<i>of Independence.</i>

897
01:12:50,224 --> 01:12:52,762
<i>May seem like a strange word</i>
<i>to be in that document...</i>

898
01:12:52,977 --> 01:12:57,888
<i>... but he was sort of...</i>
<i>He was an artist.</i>

899
01:12:58,149 --> 01:13:02,727
<i>He called the English</i>
<i>"the disturbers of our harmony."</i>

900
01:13:03,029 --> 01:13:04,772
<i>And I remember standing there</i>
<i>that day...</i>

901
01:13:04,989 --> 01:13:07,278
<i>... thinking about</i>
<i>the disturbers of mine.</i>

902
01:13:07,491 --> 01:13:11,738
<i>Questions I had.</i>
<i>Whether all this was good.</i>

903
01:13:12,121 --> 01:13:13,912
<i>Whether I'd make it.</i>

904
01:13:16,917 --> 01:13:19,918
<i>And Walter Ribbon</i>
<i>and his Pacific Bell pension money...</i>

905
01:13:20,129 --> 01:13:21,457
<i>... which was millions.</i>

906
01:13:21,672 --> 01:13:23,297
Yeah!

907
01:13:23,758 --> 01:13:26,675
<i>It was a way to another place.</i>

908
01:13:27,428 --> 01:13:29,551
Wow, this is...

909
01:13:29,930 --> 01:13:31,888
This is the way
to watch a football game here.

910
01:13:32,099 --> 01:13:35,184
- Thank you very much for this, really.
- Hey, it's my pleasure, Chris.

911
01:13:35,394 --> 01:13:38,644
And, Mr. Ribbon, I also wanna thank
you for giving me the opportunity...

912
01:13:38,856 --> 01:13:41,727
...to discuss the asset management
capabilities of Dean Witter...

913
01:13:42,026 --> 01:13:44,184
...which we believe
to be far superior...

914
01:13:44,403 --> 01:13:46,977
...to anything you got going
over at Morgan Stanley.

915
01:13:47,198 --> 01:13:49,025
Really, I think you're gonna
be blown away.

916
01:13:49,533 --> 01:13:54,279
Point blank, Dean Witter needs to be
managing your retirement portfolio.

917
01:13:54,497 --> 01:13:57,035
You know, I didn't have any notion
that you were new there.

918
01:13:57,249 --> 01:14:00,701
I like you, but there's not a chance
I'm gonna let you direct our fund.

919
01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:02,996
That's just not gonna happen
anytime soon, buddy.

920
01:14:03,214 --> 01:14:06,334
So, you know, come on, relax.
Enjoy the game. Go, go, go!

921
01:14:07,301 --> 01:14:08,582
Yes!

922
01:14:11,597 --> 01:14:13,637
Yes! Yeah!

923
01:14:18,354 --> 01:14:19,385
- Here you go.
- All right.

924
01:14:19,605 --> 01:14:21,349
I've had a few ideas
already, absolutely.

925
01:14:21,565 --> 01:14:24,139
- Chris, I'll talk to you later.
- I'm gonna give you a call.

926
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:26,020
Nice to meet you, Chris.
Give me a call.

927
01:14:26,237 --> 01:14:27,814
Yes, absolutely. Thank you.

928
01:14:34,662 --> 01:14:37,414
- Bye.
- Bye, Christopher.

929
01:15:06,902 --> 01:15:11,446
<i>After four months, we had sold</i>
<i>all our scanners.</i>

930
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:14,117
<i>It seemed we were making it.</i>

931
01:15:15,036 --> 01:15:16,281
What's the...

932
01:15:16,662 --> 01:15:19,153
...fastest animal in the world?
- Jackrabbit.

933
01:15:21,375 --> 01:15:24,791
<i>It seemed we were doing good.</i>

934
01:15:25,004 --> 01:15:26,747
<i>Until one day...</i>

935
01:15:27,006 --> 01:15:28,714
<i>... that day...</i>

936
01:15:29,258 --> 01:15:31,215
<i>... that letter brought me</i>

937
01:15:38,601 --> 01:15:41,174
<i>This part of my life is called</i>
<i>"Paying Taxes."</i>

938
01:15:43,230 --> 01:15:44,559
<i>If you didn't pay them...</i>

939
01:15:44,774 --> 01:15:47,691
<i>... the government could stick</i>
<i>their hands into your bank account...</i>

940
01:15:48,361 --> 01:15:49,523
<i>... and take your money.</i>

941
01:15:49,737 --> 01:15:50,733
Dad.

942
01:15:50,946 --> 01:15:52,939
<i>No warning. Nothing.</i>

943
01:15:53,157 --> 01:15:56,277
It can't be too late.
That's my money.

944
01:15:56,494 --> 01:15:59,613
How is somebody just gonna
just take my money?

945
01:15:59,955 --> 01:16:01,236
I was... I was...

946
01:16:01,457 --> 01:16:04,743
Listen, I...
That's all the money that I have.

947
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:09,254
You cannot go into my bank acc...
No...

948
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:11,837
<i>It was the 25th of September.</i>

949
01:16:12,051 --> 01:16:13,759
<i>I remember that day.</i>

950
01:16:13,970 --> 01:16:16,046
<i>Because that's the day</i>
<i>that I found out...</i>

951
01:16:16,263 --> 01:16:21,388

<i>and 33 cents left in my bank account.</i>

952
01:16:21,602 --> 01:16:23,262
<i>I was broke.</i>

953
01:16:33,656 --> 01:16:35,945
- Dressed yet?
- No.

954
01:16:39,829 --> 01:16:43,162
Chris! Chris!
Don't jerk me around, okay, Chris?

955
01:16:43,374 --> 01:16:46,126
I'm not jerking you around, Ralph,
all right? I'm gonna get it.

956
01:16:46,335 --> 01:16:49,918
- I need that money now, not later.
- When I get it, you get it, Ralph.

957
01:16:50,131 --> 01:16:52,004
Now!

958
01:16:55,678 --> 01:16:57,754
Hey, what's happening, man?

959
01:16:58,014 --> 01:17:00,849
Wayne, I need to get
that $14 from you.

960
01:17:02,518 --> 01:17:04,392
I thought I didn't owe you that now.

961
01:17:04,603 --> 01:17:07,640
- What? Why?
- Why what?

962
01:17:07,857 --> 01:17:10,229
Why would you think
you don't owe me my money?

963
01:17:10,443 --> 01:17:12,400
I helped you move.

964
01:17:14,655 --> 01:17:17,526
You drove me two blocks, Wayne.

965
01:17:17,742 --> 01:17:19,485
That's 200 yards.

966
01:17:19,702 --> 01:17:21,659
It's been four months, Wayne.

967
01:17:21,871 --> 01:17:25,453
I need my money. I need my money.
I need my money right now.

968
01:17:25,666 --> 01:17:27,991
- I don't have it, man. I'm sorry.
- Go get my money.

969
01:17:28,210 --> 01:17:30,417
- Wayne, get my mo...
- I really don't, man. It's $14.

970
01:17:30,630 --> 01:17:32,337
It's my $14!
Go get my money!

971
01:17:32,548 --> 01:17:35,086
- All of this for $14.
- Get my money, Wayne.

972
01:17:53,444 --> 01:17:55,602
Dad, look at me!

973
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:57,780
Dad.

974
01:17:58,783 --> 01:18:02,317
- Should I go?
- Sure, man. Why not?

975
01:18:18,386 --> 01:18:19,417
- Stay here.
- Dad, look.

976
01:18:19,637 --> 01:18:21,214
- No, no. Stay right here.
- Dad.

977
01:18:21,430 --> 01:18:24,217
Did you hear what I said?
Did you hear me?

978
01:18:29,313 --> 01:18:32,813
- Dad, where you going?
- Hey, what did I say?

979
01:18:35,861 --> 01:18:37,486
Dad!

980
01:18:37,697 --> 01:18:41,066
Dad, wait! Dad!

981
01:18:49,250 --> 01:18:51,289
- Dad.
- I gotta...

982
01:18:51,502 --> 01:18:54,871
I gotta get back to the '60s, man.
That's what I wanna do.

983
01:18:55,089 --> 01:18:59,383
When I was younger. I wanna see
Jimi Hendrix do that guitar on fire.

984
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:05,141
Bring back my time machine!

985
01:19:06,475 --> 01:19:08,135
Bring my time machine back!

986
01:19:17,028 --> 01:19:20,610
- Dad, where are we going?
- Be quiet.

987
01:19:21,240 --> 01:19:23,945
Go get your things. Go.

988
01:19:47,183 --> 01:19:48,843
- Chris?
- Yes.

989
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:52,974
Dr. Telm can't get back to meet you.
I'm sorry.

990
01:20:04,158 --> 01:20:06,614
Where are we going now?

991
01:20:07,370 --> 01:20:10,655
We gotta... We gotta
see somebody else.

992
01:20:12,750 --> 01:20:14,873
I'm tired.

993
01:20:16,879 --> 01:20:18,504
I know.

994
01:20:25,888 --> 01:20:30,016
Doesn't seem to be functioning
right now.

995
01:20:30,434 --> 01:20:32,723
- I have to go now, Chris.
- No, no, no.

996
01:20:32,937 --> 01:20:36,804
Just give me a second. I'm sure
I'm gonna be able to figure it out.

997
01:20:38,609 --> 01:20:40,898
Chris. Chris, just come back
when it's working.

998
01:20:41,112 --> 01:20:43,947
- No, no. I have to fix it now.
- No.

999
01:20:44,156 --> 01:20:49,364
Look, I'll still be putting money
in the office, then, all right?

1000
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,701
I really have to go, Chris.

1001
01:20:52,915 --> 01:20:54,623
Thank you. Thank you.

1002
01:20:54,834 --> 01:20:56,707
Thank you for your time.
I appreciate it.

1003
01:20:56,919 --> 01:20:58,579
I'll see you soon.

1004
01:21:50,598 --> 01:21:53,005
Why are our things here?

1005
01:21:54,018 --> 01:21:55,642
Dad.

1006
01:22:38,187 --> 01:22:40,892
- Let's go. Come on.
- Where?

1007
01:22:42,525 --> 01:22:44,813
- Just out of here.
- Why?

1008
01:22:45,027 --> 01:22:48,028
- We can't stay here tonight.
- Yes, we can. Open the door!

1009
01:22:48,239 --> 01:22:51,193
- Did you hear what I said? Let's go.
- Open the door!

1010
01:22:52,910 --> 01:22:56,778
Hey, did you hear what I said?
Stop it.

1011
01:22:56,998 --> 01:22:58,492
Stop it.

1012
01:23:02,712 --> 01:23:04,170
Come on.

1013
01:23:13,264 --> 01:23:14,758
Come on.

1014
01:23:31,741 --> 01:23:33,401
<i>Wayne!</i>

1015
01:23:34,493 --> 01:23:36,367
Wayne!

1016
01:23:43,586 --> 01:23:45,875
Wayne!

1017
01:24:01,437 --> 01:24:05,138
Get up. Stand up. Come on.

1018
01:24:20,998 --> 01:24:23,038
Where are we going?

1019
01:24:25,211 --> 01:24:28,544
- Dad, where are we going?
- I don't know.

1020
01:24:44,021 --> 01:24:46,429
It's not a time machine.

1021
01:24:46,649 --> 01:24:48,060
Dad.

1022
01:24:48,442 --> 01:24:49,771
It's not a time machine.

1023
01:24:49,986 --> 01:24:53,236
The guy said it was a time machine.
It's not a time machine. He was wrong.

1024
01:24:53,656 --> 01:24:55,981
- What guy?
- The guy. He was at the park.

1025
01:24:56,242 --> 01:24:58,116
He said it was a time machine.

1026
01:25:04,458 --> 01:25:05,703
Yes, it is.

1027
01:25:07,295 --> 01:25:09,086
No, it's not.

1028
01:25:11,090 --> 01:25:13,047
- It is.
- No, it's not.

1029
01:25:19,265 --> 01:25:23,808
All we gotta do is push
this black button right here.

1030
01:25:26,981 --> 01:25:28,143
Wanna push it?

1031
01:25:32,653 --> 01:25:34,313
Okay.

1032
01:25:35,865 --> 01:25:37,442
Come on.

1033
01:25:38,951 --> 01:25:40,576
Come on, man.

1034
01:25:46,250 --> 01:25:47,329
Right here.

1035
01:25:47,710 --> 01:25:49,334
Wait a minute.
Where you wanna go?

1036
01:25:49,670 --> 01:25:51,663
I don't know.
Some place from before.

1037
01:25:52,214 --> 01:25:53,459
You gotta close your eyes.

1038
01:25:53,758 --> 01:25:55,631
You close your eyes. I wanna see.

1039
01:25:57,803 --> 01:26:00,211
All right, come on.
We'll push it together.

1040
01:26:06,020 --> 01:26:07,847
You gotta close your eyes.
Close your eyes.

1041
01:26:08,564 --> 01:26:10,723
It takes a few seconds.

1042
01:26:13,152 --> 01:26:15,026
Oh, my goodness.

1043
01:26:15,237 --> 01:26:17,444
Open, open, open!

1044
01:26:20,826 --> 01:26:23,496
- What is it?
- Dinosaurs.

1045
01:26:23,704 --> 01:26:25,863
- Where?
- You don't see all these dinosaurs?

1046
01:26:27,249 --> 01:26:30,915
Look around.
Look at all these dinosaurs.

1047
01:26:32,672 --> 01:26:35,044
- Do you see them?
- Yeah.

1048
01:26:35,257 --> 01:26:36,668
Wait. Come on, come on.

1049
01:26:36,884 --> 01:26:38,213
- Wait, watch out.
- What is it?

1050
01:26:38,427 --> 01:26:40,467
Don't step in the fire.
We're cavemen.

1051
01:26:40,805 --> 01:26:43,047
We need this fire,
because there's no electricity...

1052
01:26:43,265 --> 01:26:44,676
...and it's cold out here, okay?

1053
01:26:45,393 --> 01:26:47,718
- Watch out!
- Whoa! Oh, my good... A <i>T. rex.</i>

1054
01:26:47,937 --> 01:26:51,555
Get your stuff.
Get your stuff. Get it.

1055
01:26:52,566 --> 01:26:55,651
- We gotta find someplace safe.
- Like what?

1056
01:26:55,861 --> 01:26:57,819
We need a cave.

1057
01:26:58,030 --> 01:26:59,109
A cave?

1058
01:26:59,323 --> 01:27:01,363
- We gotta find a cave. Come on.
- Okay.

1059
01:27:01,575 --> 01:27:03,319
Come on, come on.

1060
01:27:04,912 --> 01:27:06,287
Watch your back! Look out.

1061
01:27:06,497 --> 01:27:08,537
Here it is. Here's a cave. Come on.

1062
01:27:08,749 --> 01:27:11,620
Right here, right here.
Go, go, go.

1063
01:27:11,836 --> 01:27:13,081
Go ahead. Get in.

1064
01:27:13,296 --> 01:27:15,122
Hurry, hurry, hurry.

1065
01:27:18,759 --> 01:27:22,508
- Are we safe?
- Yeah, I think so.

1066
01:28:30,498 --> 01:28:32,122
Hey.

1067
01:28:33,709 --> 01:28:35,334
- How you doing, Jay?
- I'm doing good.

1068
01:28:35,544 --> 01:28:37,003
How are you getting along?

1069
01:28:37,213 --> 01:28:39,371
- Good. I'm good.
- You doing good?

1070
01:28:39,590 --> 01:28:42,128
- How you doing?
- I'm doing great.

1071
01:28:43,260 --> 01:28:44,885
Where you going?

1072
01:28:48,182 --> 01:28:51,183
I... Sacramento.

1073
01:28:51,894 --> 01:28:54,515
Because I'm trying to move
a couple guys from...

1074
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:57,352
They're at PacBell,
and I'm trying to bring them over...

1075
01:28:57,566 --> 01:28:58,811
Get them over to us.

1076
01:28:59,026 --> 01:29:00,734
So they got me
going out there golfing.

1077
01:29:00,945 --> 01:29:02,772
Awesome.

1078
01:29:02,989 --> 01:29:04,946
Hey, let them win a round.

1079
01:29:10,121 --> 01:29:12,113
Deborah, someone's asking for you.

1080
01:29:12,331 --> 01:29:15,416
- Where?
- He's outside. Please come with me.

1081
01:29:23,259 --> 01:29:26,758
- Hi.
- How you doing?

1082
01:29:28,180 --> 01:29:30,718
- Can I ask you a question?
- Sure.

1083
01:29:32,935 --> 01:29:34,560
We need a room.

1084
01:29:35,187 --> 01:29:38,141
Just until I can fix this and sell it.

1085
01:29:38,357 --> 01:29:40,979
- There's just some glass work.
- Let me stop you right there.

1086
01:29:41,193 --> 01:29:43,649
- I wish I could help you...
- This is my son, Christopher.

1087
01:29:43,988 --> 01:29:45,980
- He's 5 years old.
- Hi, baby.

1088
01:29:46,198 --> 01:29:49,235
- We need some place to stay.
- Okay, and I would love to help you...

1089
01:29:49,452 --> 01:29:52,322
...but we don't take men here.
It's only women and children.

1090
01:29:52,538 --> 01:29:55,574
He can stay here, but you have
to find someplace else to go.

1091
01:29:55,791 --> 01:29:57,202
We gotta stay together.

1092
01:29:57,418 --> 01:29:58,746
We got... We're...

1093
01:29:58,961 --> 01:30:00,788
- Okay, listen.
- You gotta have some place...

1094
01:30:01,005 --> 01:30:03,875
Try Glide Memorial.
The building books up at 5.

1095
01:30:04,091 --> 01:30:05,586
So you hurry up. There's a line.

1096
01:30:05,801 --> 01:30:09,170
- And where is it? Come on.
- Ellis and Jones.

1097
01:30:44,423 --> 01:30:50,047
Hey, everybody. We have
four spots left, and that's all.

1098
01:30:50,471 --> 01:30:53,342
- Man.
- Hey, come on, man.

1099
01:30:53,557 --> 01:30:54,756
- Come on.
- Come on, what?

1100
01:30:54,976 --> 01:30:56,553
- Hey, that's my spot.
- Back off.

1101
01:30:56,769 --> 01:30:59,177
Come on, don't do this to me.
Don't...

1102
01:31:01,565 --> 01:31:03,143
Dad!

1103
01:31:03,567 --> 01:31:05,643
Stop it! Break it up!
Break it up!

1104
01:31:05,861 --> 01:31:07,439
Stop! Stop!

1105
01:31:07,655 --> 01:31:09,944
Get out of line, both of you.
Both of you.

1106
01:31:10,157 --> 01:31:12,731
I was here first. They told me
that we had to be on time.

1107
01:31:13,035 --> 01:31:14,992
I got here on time. I was in line.

1108
01:31:15,204 --> 01:31:16,947
I came from work, I got my son.

1109
01:31:17,164 --> 01:31:19,655
I was here on time.
We were here on time!

1110
01:31:19,875 --> 01:31:21,500
He sliced in front of him in line.

1111
01:31:21,711 --> 01:31:23,999
- Who did?
- He did.

1112
01:31:24,255 --> 01:31:28,798
Come on, come on, Rodney.
Come on. Let's go. Get out of line.

1113
01:31:38,060 --> 01:31:40,017
That's it. No more.

1114
01:31:47,069 --> 01:31:50,023
- What's your favourite colour?
- Green.

1115
01:31:50,239 --> 01:31:51,484
Green?

1116
01:31:51,699 --> 01:31:54,700
- What do you like that's green?
- Trees.

1117
01:31:54,910 --> 01:31:57,864
Trees. What else?

1118
01:31:58,080 --> 01:31:59,539
Holly.

1119
01:32:01,334 --> 01:32:05,283
- Holly. What's holly?
- The Christmas stuff.

1120
01:32:06,047 --> 01:32:08,039
Christmas stuff.

1121
01:32:08,841 --> 01:32:10,584
What's that?

1122
01:32:13,804 --> 01:32:16,722
I guess they want us to go to sleep.

1123
01:32:23,272 --> 01:32:28,267
Here you go. We gotta make sure
Captain America's warm in there.

1124
01:32:28,736 --> 01:32:30,444
Can he breathe?

1125
01:32:30,655 --> 01:32:32,896
- He's good?
- Yeah.

1126
01:32:33,366 --> 01:32:35,358
- I gotta go work on the scanner...
- Don't go.

1127
01:32:35,576 --> 01:32:38,743
No, no, no. I'm gonna be
right outside the door.

1128
01:32:38,954 --> 01:32:43,083
All right? I'm just gonna be right there.
I'll leave the door open a little bit.

1129
01:32:43,584 --> 01:32:46,253
And I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1130
01:32:46,462 --> 01:32:48,953
I wanna go home.

1131
01:32:51,050 --> 01:32:54,834
But that's why I gotta
work on the scanner.

1132
01:32:55,805 --> 01:32:57,548
All right?

1133
01:32:57,765 --> 01:32:59,674
I'm gonna go out there.

1134
01:32:59,892 --> 01:33:03,261
I'm gonna leave the door open.
I'll be right up the stairs.

1135
01:33:04,355 --> 01:33:06,063
I'll be able to hear you
if you call me.

1136
01:33:07,024 --> 01:33:09,147
- All right?
- All right.

1137
01:33:09,360 --> 01:33:11,685
You gotta trust me, okay?

1138
01:33:11,904 --> 01:33:13,944
You gotta trust me.

1139
01:33:14,824 --> 01:33:17,445
I trust you. I trust you.

1140
01:33:17,660 --> 01:33:19,119
I trust you.

1141
01:33:19,328 --> 01:33:22,282
- I can't hear you.
- I trust you. I trust you.

1142
01:33:26,127 --> 01:33:27,835
Give me a kiss.

1143
01:33:40,516 --> 01:33:43,470
- I'll just be a little while, okay?
- All right.

1144
01:33:43,936 --> 01:33:46,392
- I'll be right here.
- Okay.

1145
01:33:46,605 --> 01:33:48,812
- Can you still hear me?
- Yeah.

1146
01:33:49,025 --> 01:33:50,483
- Can you hear me?
- Yeah.

1147
01:33:50,735 --> 01:33:53,190
- Do you trust me?
- Yeah.

1148
01:34:40,409 --> 01:34:42,069
- Yeah.
- Like that?

1149
01:34:42,286 --> 01:34:45,951
- Yeah, put that...
- Then you go like that.

1150
01:34:46,165 --> 01:34:49,664
- Is that okay?
- I don't know. What do you think?

1151
01:34:49,877 --> 01:34:50,908
Good.

1152
01:34:52,254 --> 01:34:54,496
Let's go. Get your stuff.

1153
01:34:55,758 --> 01:34:58,712
- Dad, why don't you leave it?
- We can't.

1154
01:34:58,928 --> 01:35:01,051
We're gonna have
a different room later.

1155
01:35:01,263 --> 01:35:02,806
Go.

1156
01:35:08,145 --> 01:35:09,521
Hey, Chris.

1157
01:35:09,730 --> 01:35:13,064
- Hey, good morning, Mr. Frakesh.
- What's up?

1158
01:35:14,110 --> 01:35:15,224
Work trip.

1159
01:35:15,444 --> 01:35:17,733
Your wife, Martha, works at
PacBell also, correct?

1160
01:35:17,947 --> 01:35:19,690
- Yes, she does.
- And you guys are both...

1161
01:35:19,907 --> 01:35:21,567
...looking to retire at the same time?

1162
01:35:21,784 --> 01:35:23,860
We'd like to retire
and maintain our lifestyle...

1163
01:35:24,078 --> 01:35:25,489
...without paying a lot of taxes.

1164
01:35:25,705 --> 01:35:29,204
So basically, you want nobody's hands
in your pockets but your own?

1165
01:35:29,792 --> 01:35:31,701
Are you familiar with
tax-free municipal?

1166
01:35:31,919 --> 01:35:33,793
<i>I learned to finish my work quickly.</i>

1167
01:35:34,130 --> 01:35:36,288
<i>I had to finish quickly.</i>

1168
01:35:36,632 --> 01:35:40,132
<i>To get in line at Glide by 5.</i>

1169
01:35:43,848 --> 01:35:45,757
Come on.

1170
01:35:46,267 --> 01:35:47,844
Come on.

1171
01:35:51,939 --> 01:35:54,726
Hold that bus! Hold the bus!

1172
01:35:55,609 --> 01:35:57,353
My Captain America!

1173
01:35:57,611 --> 01:35:59,900
Dad! Dad! Dad!

1174
01:36:00,114 --> 01:36:03,364
Stop it! Shut up! Shut up!

1175
01:36:05,703 --> 01:36:07,742
- Why don't you let the lady in?
- Hey, back up.

1176
01:36:07,955 --> 01:36:10,992
- Hey, man, that's not cool.
- Back up! Back up!

1177
01:36:19,342 --> 01:36:20,800
Come on.

1178
01:36:23,804 --> 01:36:26,011
Dad, we need to get it!

1179
01:36:28,643 --> 01:36:31,264
<i>The important thing about</i>
<i>that freedom train...</i>

1180
01:36:31,479 --> 01:36:33,637
<i>... is it's got to climb mountains.</i>

1181
01:36:33,856 --> 01:36:36,608
<i>We all have to deal with mountains.</i>

1182
01:36:36,817 --> 01:36:39,735
<i>You know, mountains</i>
<i>that go way up high.</i>

1183
01:36:40,154 --> 01:36:42,147
And mountains that go
deep and low.

1184
01:36:42,365 --> 01:36:43,645
- Amen, preacher!
- Yes.

1185
01:36:43,866 --> 01:36:46,155
We know what those mountains are,
here at Glide.

1186
01:36:46,452 --> 01:36:48,575
We sing about them.

1187
01:36:49,372 --> 01:36:54,876
<i>Lord, don't move that mountain</i>

1188
01:36:56,295 --> 01:37:02,713
<i>Give me strength to climb it</i>

1189
01:37:03,219 --> 01:37:09,886
<i>Please don't move</i>
<i>That stumbling block</i>

1190
01:37:10,101 --> 01:37:16,684
<i>But lead me, Lord, around it</i>

1191
01:37:18,317 --> 01:37:23,359
<i>My burdens, they get so heavy</i>

1192
01:37:25,199 --> 01:37:30,822
<i>Seems hard to bear</i>

1193
01:37:31,747 --> 01:37:35,330
<i>But I won't give up</i>
<i>No, no</i>

1194
01:37:35,543 --> 01:37:37,535
<i>Because you promised me</i>

1195
01:37:37,753 --> 01:37:44,503
<i>You'd meet me at the altar of prayer</i>

1196
01:37:44,719 --> 01:37:52,216
- <i>Lord don't move that mountain</i>
- <i>Please don't move that mountain</i>

1197
01:37:52,435 --> 01:37:57,725
<i>But give me strength to climb it</i>

1198
01:37:59,942 --> 01:38:01,935
When's your test?

1199
01:38:03,154 --> 01:38:04,648
Tomorrow.

1200
01:38:09,035 --> 01:38:10,826
Are you ready?

1201
01:38:14,749 --> 01:38:16,159
Of course.

1202
01:38:55,289 --> 01:38:56,570
Thank you, sir.

1203
01:39:05,967 --> 01:39:08,125
- Hey. How you doing?
- Hey.

1204
01:39:12,181 --> 01:39:15,135
So did you finish the whole thing,
or you have to go somewhere?

1205
01:39:15,351 --> 01:39:17,806
I have to go somewhere.

1206
01:39:18,396 --> 01:39:21,231
- But I finished the whole thing too.
- Oh, good.

1207
01:39:21,440 --> 01:39:23,350
- You?
- Yeah.

1208
01:39:23,859 --> 01:39:26,813
- How'd you feel about the graphs?
- Easy.

1209
01:39:27,863 --> 01:39:31,908
I struggled with the essay question
on the back. What did you write?

1210
01:39:32,118 --> 01:39:35,736
- Essay question?
- Yeah, on the back.

1211
01:39:45,673 --> 01:39:47,001
Hey, Chris.

1212
01:39:47,216 --> 01:39:50,502
- Hey. Jeff, right? 49ers game.
- Yeah.

1213
01:39:50,720 --> 01:39:54,171
- Yeah, you were gonna give me a call?
- I never actually got your number.

1214
01:39:55,933 --> 01:39:57,890
Here's my number.
Call me, okay?

1215
01:39:58,102 --> 01:40:00,771
Yes, sir. Absolutely.
Thank you very much.

1216
01:40:01,564 --> 01:40:05,312
Chris, you got five bucks?
I left my wallet upstairs.

1217
01:40:05,526 --> 01:40:07,768
Let me run up and grab that
for you, Mr. Frohm.

1218
01:40:07,987 --> 01:40:10,988
No, I gotta be at CAL Bank at 4,
and I'm late.

1219
01:40:16,370 --> 01:40:18,529
- I'll pay you back, honest.
- Five is good?

1220
01:40:18,748 --> 01:40:22,366
Five is lovely. Thank you.
Thank you.

1221
01:40:35,723 --> 01:40:38,214
That's it. That's the room quota.

1222
01:40:38,601 --> 01:40:41,353
There's no more space.
You gotta head out.

1223
01:40:41,562 --> 01:40:44,433
That's it for today.
Come back tomorrow.

1224
01:40:44,649 --> 01:40:47,649
All the rooms are full.
It's completely full.

1225
01:40:47,860 --> 01:40:52,154
That's it. Just keep heading out.
Come back tomorrow.

1226
01:41:27,149 --> 01:41:28,893
You like it?

1227
01:42:19,952 --> 01:42:23,617
Twenty. One, two, three, four.

1228
01:42:26,709 --> 01:42:30,327
Now, here's your bulb,
and there's your ferrite core inductor.

1229
01:42:30,546 --> 01:42:33,333
- How much?
- Eight dollars.

1230
01:42:34,425 --> 01:42:37,759
- What's that?
- It's to repair the light.

1231
01:42:37,970 --> 01:42:40,010
Can I see it?

1232
01:42:41,891 --> 01:42:44,975
Yeah, sure. Just don't break it.

1233
01:42:45,186 --> 01:42:49,682
Unless you wanna sleep in a room
with me for the rest of your life.

1234
01:42:50,900 --> 01:42:52,727
I don't mind.

1235
01:42:53,235 --> 01:42:55,027
Yeah, you will.

1236
01:43:11,337 --> 01:43:13,709
Why don't you
get some sleep, okay?

1237
01:43:13,923 --> 01:43:15,037
Okay.

1238
01:43:15,257 --> 01:43:18,377
- Warm enough?
- Yeah.

1239
01:43:18,636 --> 01:43:20,296
All right.

1240
01:43:22,431 --> 01:43:25,302
Did Mom leave because of me?

1241
01:43:28,646 --> 01:43:32,857
- What?
- Did Mom leave because of me?

1242
01:43:37,446 --> 01:43:41,942
Don't... Don't even think
something like that.

1243
01:43:43,035 --> 01:43:45,158
Mom left because of Mom.

1244
01:43:45,371 --> 01:43:47,613
And you didn't have anything
to do with that, okay?

1245
01:43:48,332 --> 01:43:50,241
Okay.

1246
01:44:00,094 --> 01:44:02,134
You're a good papa.

1247
01:44:09,979 --> 01:44:11,971
All right, go to sleep.

1248
01:44:12,815 --> 01:44:15,733
- I love you.
- I love you too.

1249
01:45:12,208 --> 01:45:14,165
So far, so good, Chris.

1250
01:45:20,257 --> 01:45:22,831
- It works.
- Thank you very much.

1251
01:45:23,052 --> 01:45:26,836
<i>Two hundred and fifty dollars.</i>
<i>Four more weeks of oxygen.</i>

1252
01:45:27,223 --> 01:45:31,434
One hundred, 20, 40, 60, 80, 200.

1253
01:45:31,644 --> 01:45:34,396
Twenty, 30, 40, 50.

1254
01:45:35,564 --> 01:45:37,189
- Anything else?
- Nope, that's it.

1255
01:45:37,400 --> 01:45:38,680
Thank you. Thank you.

1256
01:45:38,901 --> 01:45:40,858
- You ready?
- Yep.

1257
01:45:42,780 --> 01:45:45,697
- Are we going to the church place?
- No.

1258
01:45:45,908 --> 01:45:47,865
Where are we going, then?

1259
01:45:48,661 --> 01:45:51,199
- Probably stay at a hotel.
- A hotel?

1260
01:45:51,414 --> 01:45:52,493
Just for the night.

1261
01:45:52,707 --> 01:45:55,458
We can go back to the cave
if you like.

1262
01:45:55,668 --> 01:45:57,376
No, thank you.

1263
01:45:57,586 --> 01:46:00,124
- Ever?
- I hope not.

1264
01:46:00,339 --> 01:46:01,798
Why not?

1265
01:46:02,008 --> 01:46:04,795
Well, because some things are fun
the first time you do them...

1266
01:46:05,011 --> 01:46:07,336
...and then not so much the next.

1267
01:46:07,555 --> 01:46:10,425
- Like the bus?
- Yeah, like the bus.

1268
01:46:10,641 --> 01:46:14,093
<i>I'm sorry. Guess I shouldn't laugh,</i>
<i>should I?</i>

1269
01:46:14,312 --> 01:46:17,681
<i>It's promised in the Bible.</i>
<i>Pa says we'll find it some day.</i>

1270
01:46:17,898 --> 01:46:20,271
<i>He doesn't know where it is, though.</i>

1271
01:46:21,193 --> 01:46:24,397
<i>Didn't you ever want to have a home</i>
<i>of your own like other people?</i>

1272
01:46:24,613 --> 01:46:26,440
<i>Sure.</i>

1273
01:46:26,866 --> 01:46:28,942
<i>Sometimes when we're moving</i>
<i>at night...</i>

1274
01:46:29,160 --> 01:46:32,326
<i>... we pass houses with lights</i>
<i>and people.</i>

1275
01:46:32,538 --> 01:46:35,290
<i>Sometimes you can</i>
<i>hear them laughing...</i>

1276
01:46:39,545 --> 01:46:42,914
<i>The next day, after work...</i>

1277
01:46:43,132 --> 01:46:45,338
<i>... we just went to the beach.</i>

1278
01:46:45,551 --> 01:46:47,425
<i>Far away from anything.</i>

1279
01:46:47,637 --> 01:46:49,012
<i>Everything.</i>

1280
01:46:49,221 --> 01:46:50,881
<i>Just Christopher and me.</i>

1281
01:46:52,516 --> 01:46:54,889
- Did you see me?
- Yeah.

1282
01:46:55,102 --> 01:46:58,187
<i>Far away from buses and noise...</i>

1283
01:46:58,397 --> 01:47:04,021
<i>... and a constant disappointment</i>
<i>in my ten-gallon head...</i>

1284
01:47:05,196 --> 01:47:07,069
<i>... and in myself.</i>

1285
01:47:07,657 --> 01:47:10,029
- Chris, thank you very much.
- Well, thank you, Dean.

1286
01:47:10,242 --> 01:47:12,069
- Take care.
- You made all the right moves.

1287
01:47:12,286 --> 01:47:13,780
Thanks, Chris.

1288
01:47:15,873 --> 01:47:17,201
<i>Because when I was young...</i>

1289
01:47:17,416 --> 01:47:21,165
<i>... and I'd get an A on a history test</i>
<i>or whatever...</i>

1290
01:47:21,379 --> 01:47:25,957
<i>... I'd get this good feeling about</i>
<i>all the things that I could be.</i>

1291
01:47:27,885 --> 01:47:31,503
<i>And then I never became</i>
<i>any of them.</i>

1292
01:47:39,021 --> 01:47:41,559
- Hey, Chris.
- Hey.

1293
01:47:41,774 --> 01:47:44,395
- How you doing, Jay?
- I'm doing fine.

1294
01:47:44,610 --> 01:47:48,738
Rumour has it you signed 31 accounts
for us from Pacific Bell.

1295
01:47:48,948 --> 01:47:50,359
Yeah, yeah.

1296
01:47:50,574 --> 01:47:54,358
Met some guys at a ball game,
got some cards. I've been working.

1297
01:47:54,578 --> 01:47:56,203
I guess.

1298
01:47:59,208 --> 01:48:01,414
So one more day.

1299
01:48:01,627 --> 01:48:03,205
Getting nervous?

1300
01:48:03,796 --> 01:48:06,168
- No, I'm okay.
- Yeah?

1301
01:48:06,382 --> 01:48:08,291
Listen, whatever happens...

1302
01:48:08,509 --> 01:48:10,917
...you've done a fantastic job, Chris.

1303
01:48:11,137 --> 01:48:12,679
I mean that.

1304
01:48:13,556 --> 01:48:15,347
Take care of yourself.

1305
01:48:30,406 --> 01:48:33,526
Yes, Mr. Johnson.
Chris Gardner, Dean Witter.

1306
01:48:33,868 --> 01:48:35,944
Yes, sir. Just calling
to thank you very much...

1307
01:48:36,162 --> 01:48:38,653
...for your support
at last month's seminar.

1308
01:48:39,206 --> 01:48:40,866
Yes, sir. Absolutely.

1309
01:48:41,500 --> 01:48:43,125
Yes, sir.

1310
01:48:43,336 --> 01:48:44,711
No, sir, that's it.

1311
01:48:44,920 --> 01:48:47,376
Thank you very much. Bye-bye.

1312
01:48:49,008 --> 01:48:51,878
Chris. Come.

1313
01:49:19,288 --> 01:49:22,372
- Hi, Chris.
- Mr. Frohm, good to see you.

1314
01:49:23,501 --> 01:49:25,410
- Nice shirt.
- Thank you, sir.

1315
01:49:25,628 --> 01:49:26,826
- Chris.
- Hey, Jay.

1316
01:49:27,296 --> 01:49:31,543
- Chris.
- Chris, sit down, please.

1317
01:49:34,470 --> 01:49:38,550
I thought I'd wear a shirt today.

1318
01:49:38,766 --> 01:49:40,723
You know,
being the last day and all.

1319
01:49:40,935 --> 01:49:44,268
Well, thank you. Thank you.
We appreciate that.

1320
01:49:45,147 --> 01:49:46,939
But...

1321
01:49:47,149 --> 01:49:49,937
...wear one tomorrow though, okay?

1322
01:49:50,152 --> 01:49:53,070
Because tomorrow's
going to be your first day...

1323
01:49:53,823 --> 01:49:57,026
...if you'd like to work here
as a broker.

1324
01:49:58,369 --> 01:50:00,196
Would you like that, Chris?

1325
01:50:01,122 --> 01:50:02,699
Yes, sir.

1326
01:50:02,915 --> 01:50:06,284
Good. We couldn't be happier.

1327
01:50:07,253 --> 01:50:10,420
So welcome.

1328
01:50:12,300 --> 01:50:17,294
- Was it as easy as it looked?
- No, sir. No, sir, it wasn't.

1329
01:50:19,640 --> 01:50:22,012
- Good luck, Chris.
- Thank you. Thank you.

1330
01:50:26,439 --> 01:50:28,099
Thank you, sir.

1331
01:50:28,441 --> 01:50:30,314
Oh, Chris.

1332
01:50:32,820 --> 01:50:34,896
I almost forgot.

1333
01:50:36,949 --> 01:50:38,491
Thank you.

1334
01:50:58,888 --> 01:51:01,094
<i>This part of my life...</i>

1335
01:51:02,016 --> 01:51:04,174
<i>... this little part...</i>

1336
01:51:07,563 --> 01:51:10,184
<i>... is called "Happiness."</i>

1337
01:51:56,904 --> 01:52:00,522
Christopher. Christopher.
Come here.

1338
01:52:30,187 --> 01:52:32,595
So how many...

1339
01:52:32,815 --> 01:52:34,724
...planets are there?

1340
01:52:36,027 --> 01:52:37,818
- Seven.
- Seven?

1341
01:52:38,321 --> 01:52:40,147
Nine.

1342
01:52:42,533 --> 01:52:44,609
Who's the king of the jungle?

1343
01:52:44,994 --> 01:52:47,746
- Gorilla.
- The gorilla?

1344
01:52:48,039 --> 01:52:49,449
The gorilla?

1345
01:52:49,665 --> 01:52:51,290
No. Lion.

1346
01:52:51,500 --> 01:52:54,122
Oh, yeah. Lion, lion, lion.

1347
01:52:56,172 --> 01:52:59,173
Hey, Dad, listen to this.
Knock, knock.

1348
01:52:59,383 --> 01:53:01,292
- Who's there?
- Shelby.

1349
01:53:01,510 --> 01:53:02,625
Shelby who?

1350
01:53:02,845 --> 01:53:06,629
<i>Shelby coming around the mountain</i>
<i>When she comes</i>

1351
01:53:07,475 --> 01:53:08,803
- Knock knock.
- Who's there?

1352
01:53:09,018 --> 01:53:11,473
- Nobody.
- Nobody who?

1353
01:53:12,396 --> 01:53:14,140
Nobody who?

1354
01:53:17,485 --> 01:53:20,439
Now, that's funny. I like that one.
